Data Connectors
We currently offer connectors into the following data sources. External data sources are retrieved through their APIs + corresponding authentication token. The API reference documentation can be found here.

All readers can be imported through from gpt_index.readers import .... A subset can be imported directly through from gpt_index import ...
