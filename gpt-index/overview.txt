Welcome to GPT Index!
GPT Index is a project consisting of a set of data structures designed to make it easier to use large external knowledge bases with LLMs.

Overview
Context
LLMs are a phenomenonal piece of technology for knowledge generation and reasoning.

A big limitation of LLMs is context size (e.g. Davinci’s limit is 4096 tokens. Large, but not infinite).

The ability to feed “knowledge” to LLMs is restricted to this limited prompt size and model weights.

Proposed Solution
That’s where the GPT Index comes in. GPT Index is a simple, flexible interface between your external data and LLMs. It resolves the following pain points:

Provides simple data structures to resolve prompt size limitations.

Offers data connectors to your external data sources.

Offers you a comprehensive toolset trading off cost and performance.

At the core of GPT Index is a data structure. Instead of relying on world knowledge encoded in the model weights, a GPT Index data structure does the following:

Uses a pre-trained LLM primarily for reasoning/summarization instead of prior knowledge.

Takes as input a large corpus of text data and build a structured index over it (using an LLM or heuristics).

Allow users to query the index by passing in an LLM prompt, and obtaining a response.
