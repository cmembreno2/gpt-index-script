Good afternoon.\n117000, 119000, Hey Danny.\n119000, 120000, How are you?\n120000, 122000, Well, how are you today, Mark?\n122000, 123000, Good. Yeah.\n123000, 125000, So, you're in Phoenix?\n125000, 126000, Yeah.\n126000, 127000, Yep.\n127000, 128000, Since March.\n128000, 131000, So prior to that, I was in California.\n131000, 132000, Prior.\n132000, 135000, I've been, I've been in quite a few states, but yeah.\n135000, 137000, So right now family and I live in Phoenix.\n137000, 138000, So.\n138000, 139000, Nice.\n139000, 141000, For everyone.\n141000, 142000, Good. Yeah.\n142000, 146000, We were, we were in Northern LA.\n146000, 150000, And that's called thousand Oaks.\n150000, 154000, And we were able to secure a home out here, which was nice.\n154000, 156000, And so everything's been good.\n156000, 158000, Just, you know, we're used to moving.\n158000, 168000, So we've moved from Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Texas, twice, California, twice, Arizona, New Jersey, O'Boken.\n168000, 171000, We've been quite a few states.\n171000, 175000, So we're, we're fairly familiar with the strategy on how to move efficiently.\n175000, 176000, So.\n176000, 177000, Nice.\n177000, 182000, And that's on that latest move. And I feel like that, that experience is certainly eyeopening for the family.\n182000, 187000, Hopefully the kids get to meet new people and kind of experience.\n187000, 188000, Yeah.\n188000, 195000, Now the game plan was always to move and they grew as long as we could.\n195000, 202000, And then once the kids started to get to a point where, you know, school and friends became more material, we tried to slow it down.\n202000, 206000, But they're four right now. So they got twin boys. They just started preschool.\n206000, 212000, So we still got, we can potentially do a few more moves if we need to.\n212000, 215000, Well, Phoenix is a great area. So hopefully it's cooling down now.\n215000, 219000, And yeah, it is. It's great right now. Yeah. It's just starting to cool down.\n219000, 221000, So how about you guys? Where are you at?\n221000, 227000, We're both based in New York. So our offices are in Manhattan and I live in Brooklyn, Paul lives in Manhattan.\n227000, 230000, Okay, cool.\n230000, 236000, I was fortunate to spend a month with family out in Phoenix last summer.\n236000, 244000, And so I've always been kind of in and out for different like work trips. We never really got to spend time there. So I enjoyed it.\n244000, 249000, Yeah, so far so good. I mean, we've really enjoyed it.\n249000, 267000, The we got here out in March of this year. So we went through the summer. So now it is it is cooling down. I think today's a high of 82, which is amazing. So now it's getting to be weather where, you know, I can get back outside and start jogging again and doing some outdoor activities.\n267000, 277000, But I mean, it wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. But I did hear this was a lighter year for for the heat. So we'll we'll see how it looks next year.\n277000, 289000, Makes makes good sense. Well, thank you for taking the time to chat and I know some time in the works. Certainly, Alan Driscoll spoke highly of you and thought it'd be worthwhile for us to connect.\n289000, 298000, So learn a little bit more about you know, and copper coin and tell you a little bit more about our co pilot and see what would be most helpful.\n298000, 302000, Yeah, sounds like strategy where you guys want to start off.\n302000, 315000, Sure. So happy to give you kind of a high level overview of but it might be helpful also to understand a little bit more kind of work your priorities and yeah, customized kind of the discussion from there.\n315000, 332000, Yes, my background always have been in underwriting always PNC multi line underwriting not so much on the specialty or professional line side of the house more more traditional multi line package business.\n332000, 349000, So I was a copper point back in July of 19 was responsible for underwriting for the western region and then recently took a new role in April this year so a little bit about copper point so cover point.\n349000, 367000, The legacy state funds was privatized back in July or July I don't know what month it was but 2013 let's go with that. And really at that point, you know became less, no longer the state fund and really needed to stand on their own and start to develop\n367000, 369000, their strategy.\n369000, 373000, The CEO here is a gentleman named Mark Schmillen.\n373000, 386000, And he came to us from travelers he's been with the group for about five years. And, you know, really set the group on a journey to become a billion dollar plus carrier right and.\n386000, 403000, And so, the state fund, I don't know if you know a ton about how state funds operate but you know you're more or less the, the, the provider for all insurance needs to the state and it's less about underwriting or, or, or, you know, thinking through the profit\n403000, 413000, and loss it's more about just servicing and and and quoting without much underwriting judgment or or philosophy if you will so.\n413000, 418000, So, copper point was privatized.\n418000, 424000, 2015 we're 2016 we're probably around 300 million in premium.\n424000, 430000, That was, that was back in the day before workers comp rates have really declined.\n430000, 445000, And part of the big strategy was to grow through acquisitions and so in 2019, or, excuse me, end of 2017 they purchased a company called Pacific comp, which was a standalone work operator in the state of California.\n445000, 454000, With that obviously came roughly 170 million in premium came with them a distribution in the state of California.\n454000, 474000, And then shortly thereafter about a year later they acquired Alaska national, which was which was a pretty instrumental instrumental strategic purchase for us and Alaska national very service oriented organization but they they with a lot of workers\n474000, 485000, comp expertise but they also brought state expansion. So, copper point and Pacific comp were really kind of the southwest states if you will.\n485000, 500000, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, California, and then Alaska national brought 26 state filings and multi line PNC filings across all 26 states.\n500000, 518000, And so, you know, with that it really is allowing us to start position ourselves with who do we want to be in the future right so today we're 80% may maybe closer to 90% rate premium is standalone workers comp, and 10% comes from other lines other PNC lines,\n518000, 521000, and, you know, into the future.\n521000, 536000, I would like to see that probably closer to like a 2080. In the next few years, but it's going to take some time and so anyway so back to my role so three companies coming together three relatively smaller companies right Alaska nationals 250 million.\n536000, 552000, So the comp again around 170 and the copper point was like 250 300. And everyone managed things differently everyone, you know, the field managed a lot of their, you know, making filing decisions product decisions service decisions.\n552000, 570000, And so, through bringing three companies together, obviously a lot of integration efforts are taking place, and a need for a new role stood up and are introduced itself and so I took a role for on ready systems and product back in April and so my responsibility\n570000, 582000, was to serve as the enterprise voice for you know what technology what systems do we need to drive the strategy from our underwriting standpoint, which really is all policy if you will.\n582000, 593000, And then, and then also things like customer maintenance, so things like Salesforce those those would fall under my umbrella really the tools and technology.\n593000, 604000, So it's customer base, if you will. And then, so within that it's policy I got digital, I've got Salesforce, or tools like that.\n604000, 617000, And so right now we have multiple policy systems across the enterprise we have multiple supporting products across the enterprise and so we're looking to start to, you know, come up with a vision of what does that look like going forward.\n617000, 629000, So that's one piece and then the other is product, I'm responsible for so that's, you know, product research product development maintenance of products doing filings keeping up with circulars, etc.\n629000, 646000, So, yeah, so that's, that's my role and so it's been going since about April, and right now the journey is just really kind of getting the basics or the fundamentals in place so instead of three people managing circulars, you know, having one group manage\n646000, 659000, circulars and do it across all systems, instead of, you know, three ways of it taking or submitting tickets for, you know, backlog enhancements etc having one process.\n659000, 667000, And so we're just kind of building out our, who we are, how do we work type of a mentality.\n667000, 681000, And, and, and just to be clear my team is not responsible for it, we're not responsible for the actual maintenance development we're casting the vision and partnering with our partners to bring it to life right so.\n681000, 686000, That's a, that's a long overview but hopefully gave you guys good insights.\n686000, 700000, Yeah, certainly very helpful appreciate that that comprehensive overview and it seems like in many ways, you're taking three kind of legacy platforms three legacy operations are really unifying them so that carport one is better positioned for the future\n700000, 707000, and that spans kind of the whole gamut of different operational components and underwriting support etc.\n707000, 719000, Yeah, I mean it's it's it's happening across all our enterprise so it's operations, right, how do we standardize that it's standard standing up an EDW right i mean it's everyone's going through integration.\n719000, 733000, I'm responsible for the systems and, and as it relates to underwriting as well as the product side. So, makes a lot of sense and I would wonder as you kind of think about some of the key business metrics and KPIs that you guys are excellent against.\n733000, 751000, What are some of the key objectives in terms of underwriting kind of profitability and premium birth obviously mentioned the vision of getting to $1 billion in premium I guess you guys are probably three quarters or so the way there but wonder if they're also kind of objectives\n751000, 758000, around improving loss ratio and kind of combined ratio and how that fits into what you guys are tackling day to day.\n758000, 774000, Right, we try to establish KPIs right we try to establish any strategic direction that we go to what are we going to measure ourselves against right what did we define if we achieved it or not right so anything that we can measure we try to, you know,\n774000, 792000, we're going to take it to, you know, rate retention, hit ratios quote ratios flow metrics we've we've went through the process of kind of outlining an ideal state of portfolio KPIs needed to effectively manage the business with drill down capabilities, etc.\n792000, 797000, So that's more like a PNL owner level if you will.\n797000, 810000, We're just, you know, today, we intake business differently right where in Alaska National League, they track business on Excel spreadsheets they don't put it in a policy system so you can't do flow metrics right.\n810000, 829000, We've got an ideal state of what PNL owners are going to be responsible for and what they need actual implementation of that is going to take time just because our data is fairly fractured our our different differs by entity obviously and then, you know,\n829000, 843000, we always have specific goals whether it's rate retention, new business hit ratios, new business ratings renewal retention rounding out business growth and certain verticals right.\n843000, 847000, We try and establish a lot of those as well.\n847000, 862000, You know, and we kind of take the approach of manage the goals to the level we can write and so if they become something where yeah I can give you my, your team's overall rate objective will target that for the team we might not be able to isolate that to the\n862000, 864000, individual's desk right.\n864000, 866000, Like that.\n866000, 879000, That's certainly helpful and if I recall correctly the the last year of your premium is comp, you guys are continuing to expand additional product lines I guess part of the regional expansion as well.\n879000, 897000, Yeah, so, yes, we just went through a five year pro forma, where we're really, you know, talking about what's our organic growth strategy, non M&A, and what does that mean for, you know, bringing other lines to our to try and round out our workers\n897000, 909000, and our comms solutions what does it mean to our state footprint and where do we want to have, you know, boots on the ground versus a, just a digital presence.\n909000, 925000, And so, yep, we're going through all of that, you know, I would say for the foreseeable future, our focus is going to be on our kind of 10 Western states, which is Alaska, Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, those kind of states, if you will, that\n925000, 929000, will start to drift over towards the Midwest.\n929000, 940000, But you know, a big believer in again doing, doing the basics really well executing well on those and there's a lot of market share potential in the current states that we, we penetrate.\n940000, 946000, Yeah, expansion, expansion is on the horizon just a little ways out.\n946000, 955000, That makes perfect sense so that's that's very helpful context and to give you kind of a high level sense for Aleppo.\n955000, 968000, Paul and I started the company about three years ago, really with the objective of empowering underwriters to achieve superior outcomes and the way that we do that is primarily through a software as a service capability called co pilot, which\n968000, 984000, helps underwriters make underwriting decisions, and that breaks down into kind of a few sub", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null,

know, a big believer in again doing, doing the basics really well executing well on those and there's a lot of market share potential in the current states that we, we penetrate.\n940000, 946000, Yeah, expansion, expansion is on the horizon just a little ways out.\n946000, 955000, That makes perfect sense so that's that's very helpful context and to give you kind of a high level sense for Aleppo.\n955000, 968000, Paul and I started the company about three years ago, really with the objective of empowering underwriters to achieve superior outcomes and the way that we do that is primarily through a software as a service capability called co pilot, which\n968000, 984000, helps underwriters make underwriting decisions, and that breaks down into kind of a few sub components in terms of how we're helping them to select better risk how we're helping them to prioritize their time and focus on kind of the best opportunities but ultimately\n984000, 1000000, what we see is across, across carrier is underwriters are pulled into pretty opposing directions on the one hand they're kind of asked to be very fast and very efficient in terms of getting quotes out to brokers and maintaining those relationships, essentially\n1000000, 1012000, you know saying yes wherever possible to grow premium. On the other hand, they're actually being told hey, you guys are the last kind of guardians of the quality of the book, we need to make sure that we're being, you know, very thoughtful and following\n1012000, 1020000, our guidelines and being very thorough and selecting risk. And so they're constantly, you know, toggling back between the two of those.\n1020000, 1033000, That actually through through, you know, co pilot, we can help to reconcile those and actually help underwriters do better on both dimensions. And so that's really been the focus we've been deployed at handful of largest carriers in the US and\n1033000, 1047000, continuing to grow very rapidly. And basically, you know, our clients have their submission flow flow into our co pilot software, the software helps to triage and focus the time on where they'll be actually get the biggest bang for their buck.\n1047000, 1059000, And then ultimately give them the insights that they need to know, powered by AI powered by kind of data in order to really kind of make a smarter decision use their underwriting discretion in the most effective way.\n1059000, 1072000, Yeah, voting faster, putting the right business. It's a declination get that out quickly so you can both move on and good partner to the broker. So that's kind of the 40,000.\n1072000, 1083000, I think I'm actually I mean so interesting enough I was talking to a software provider that I think probably does similar to what you're you're mentioning.\n1083000, 1089000, I called it an underwriting workbench I don't think that they liked it.\n1089000, 1102000, Because I think, you know, the reality of the tools that you guys are bringing to the table are much more dynamic and much more, you know, capable than just an underwriting workbench or workstation right.\n1102000, 1109000, But, you know, what I, what I had articulated on that conversation was that,\n1109000, 1125000, they were talking about rules and, you know, hey, imagine being able to manage your, your property capacity much more sophisticated right. So if you wanted to say, hey, in this specific territory, I need more rate or you can't write more than X amount of premium, etc.\n1125000, 1141000, You could build that rule in that it would feature underwriter, etc. And as a, as they deal through, you know, submission flow that it would, it would systematically help prioritize you know where it sits in the, in the kind of hopper if you will based on the rules, etc.\n1141000, 1170000, And, you know, where my needs are today, you know, the tools that folks like, you know, you're mine, I'm kind of just speaking in general terms I hope you don't take this to you guys specifically because, like you said, you only gave me the 40,000 foot level, you know, where you guys, where I struggle today is at the very, very basics of insurance 101 right so you talked about appetite, you know, we don't have a, a, a enterprise.\n1170000, 1183000, Enterprise wide appetite today, I mean we do but it's very generic it's, you know, red, yellow, green by by workers comp class code it's not, you know, if this is an excavator.\n1183000, 1198000, These are the types of things that you should look for you shouldn't look for or maybe minimum premiums associated with it or or guidelines or rules specifically around territories or deployment of property capacity or cat modeling, etc.\n1198000, 1201000, We're very rudimentary.\n1201000, 1204000, At this point and kind of that infrastructure.\n1204000, 1222000, And so I'm in the process of trying to build all that but it's going to be, it's going to be a journey and, you know, right now we're just trying to do the crosswalk between, you know, nakes code versus sick code versus ISO CGL versus WC IRB versus NCCI so that we can have a better way of managing appetite.\n1222000, 1230000, Designing a system that actually can adjust that and rules around that etc. Right now we're just starting to think through that.\n1230000, 1247000, But where we break down today is really more like in, in the basics of just workflow, right, and, you know, one of the the platforms that we have is guide where guide where as a policy system does things really good but what it doesn't do great is is, you know, workflow,\n1247000, 1256000, and, you know, being able to kind of manage monitor the handoffs from, you know, hey, this was submitted to me.\n1256000, 1266000, Now I went out got additional information now I passed it back to my underwriter my underwriter now has been there to, you know, they release a quote.\n1266000, 1276000, Now it actually shows status it says it's been released etc right and so they the workflow is a big gap that we're feeling right now.\n1276000, 1297000, And so, you know, as well as just being on multiple policy systems right and so guide wire is is in a lot of ways, what we're building towards for the future for workers comp we're still exploring the PNC lines and what makes best sense there for our policy system but anyway so yeah I think I've ever heard of a company called Federado.\n1297000, 1306000, Right.\n1306000, 1315000, That's the, that's the company I was mentioning there earlier but is that a general kind of overview of the tool like would you call it an underwriting workstation or how would you describe it I guess.\n1315000, 1333000, I mean I understand that you were characterized in an underwriter workbench or workstation around kind of rules and you know sorting and the like. That's probably a very small component of what co pilot does and co pilot is really moving beyond those those static roles.\n1333000, 1349000, You know when you manage the business and too much of a rigid way there are kind of too many exceptions too many things that don't fit. And therefore it all just piles up on the underwriters kind of lap. And I guess I'd wonder, you know, what is the overall submission flow that you guys are seeing\n1349000, 1357000, right now is there a certain volume that you're kind of receiving in terms of inbound submissions and how do you anticipate that background.\n1357000, 1366000, Yeah, we probably I mean enterprise wide we probably get somewhere around 20,000 submissions a year in the state of California alone we probably get 15,000.\n1366000, 1372000, And I would anticipate that only to go upward, you know, based on our partnerships.\n1372000, 1389000, We are, we do business with limited and preferred distribution channels so we're not out talking to every single brokerage and retailer we select who we want to partner with and it's based on having a sizeable mature partnership and relationship and so.\n1389000, 1402000, You know as our strategy changes as our, as our product offering grows etc in the future we would anticipate you know more and more submission flow to come. Now that being said, you know the marketplace has changed a lot.\n1402000, 1420000, And because of efficiencies and, you know, upload capabilities and OCR functionality I mean, you know, most broker partners, block the market right I mean you get a lot of submissions just because they don't want someone else to come in and snipe, snipe them\n1420000, 1432000, and, you know, try and chase them down that that that had a just a block that it wouldn't have been this right so not every submission we receive is a viable opportunity for sure.\n1432000, 1438000, And how many underwriters you have to work through that, that overall flow.\n1438000, 1443000, Good question so we probably got.\n1443000, 1450000, So we probably have about 55 underwriters.\n1450000, 1455000, Probably a mix of underwriters and assistant underwriters and kind of like.\n1455000, 1477000, I think that's probably mostly just underwriters, you know, we're very hands on service based organization and so, but also we're still dealing on Excel spreadsheets right so it's a fairly manual process today and so we do have, you know, a fairly\n1477000, 1493000, I mean, you know, with the manual load we have to staff obviously according to support that and so we have, I would guess we have probably like a two to one ratio right now, every two underwriters one AU.\n1493000, 1504000, And then with workers, I mean I'm sure you know this, you know, workers copy don't really need like a reader or someone in processing I mean it's a pretty standard.\n1504000, 1515000, Yeah, I mean it's pretty straightforward, and you know so we do have some readers, obviously that support the PNC lines where it's much more complicated submission and take and and quote process.\n1515000, 1522000, But for workers comp, usually the use or the agent just upload to the our portal.\n1522000, 1536000, Makes perfect sense and one thing that we commonly see is that organizations are just, you know, constrained as many underwriters as they have there's always just a ton of work to get done and so either you're kind of getting through the volume, but you're\n1536000, 1546000, cutting corners and underwriters are just not being as thorough and they may make you know, make pretty large mistakes which can be very costly in terms of dissipated losses.\n1546000, 1555000, On the other hand, they can kind of go into the nitty gritty and and they may just take way too long to quote and then miss opportunities and that's that's all kind of missed opportunity.\n1555000, 1571000, So the question is, how can you actually get the most out of your underwriting staff and ultimately what we see is that underwriters end up either, you know, wasting time on submissions that that never end up coding or that quote and have very low likelihood of\n1571000, 1573000, binding.\n1573000, 1588000, It doesn't fit in the box that we're looking for, or the burpers are spraying and praying and kind of wasting our time if we've seen this risk for the last four years and you know we always quote and never binds and probably don't want to waste time on it\n1588000, 1589000, this year.\n1589000, 1604000, And so really helping underwriters first of all understand kind of which opportunities are actually good ones. That's something that we can do in kind of an automated scalable way using that AI, and then with underwriter feedback observing their behavior that\n1604000, 1618000, consistently improves. And then really importantly when an underwriter is actually looking at a given risk, one thing that we see is that, you know, even if they're not working with with spreadsheets per se there's still a ton of manual work that they need to do.\n1618000, 1632000, They need to kind of go online to check you know what is the, you know, loss history and you look at news articles they might look at the business and see their customer reviews or their employee reviews, and all of that in order to kind of get the necessary data points\n1632000, 1637000, in order to develop a perspective and make a decision.\n1637000, 1652000, And so the perspective is that actually a lot of that is stuff that we can collect and make inferences on and actually present the underwriter with this is what you need to know about this risk. Let's say this is a contractor they you know they say that they don't do roofing\n1652000, 1653000, work.\n1653000, 1666000, They say they do roofing they're going to get charged more broker advised and that such, but actually, you know, software went through 300 customer reviews about this business and actually finds that seven people said, Oh, this contractor did a great job installing\n1666000, 1680000, solar panels on my roof well clearly do some roofing work and maybe there are another 20 permits for roofing you know installation in the county like Department of Buildings. Hey underwriter like this doesn't quite add up.\n1680000, 1683000, You should, you know, follow up on this. Yeah.\n1683000, 1695000, So, there won't be a scenario where you see a claim come in you know with an employee falling off the roof. If you're actually doing that proper dating upfront and understanding exactly.\n1695000, 1705000, Yeah, no, it makes a lot of sense. So, I mean, I guess just high level, you know who all plays in your tool right so is it specifically an underwriter tool only.\n1705000, 1718000, And then, you know, kind of where do you see an underwriter start with your with the deployments that you've done so far, you know, where do you see an underwriter start engaging your tool versus stop engaging your tool right so within a submission lifecycle\n1718000, 1720000, experience.\n1720000, 1735000, Well, all good questions. So generally it's underwriters and some support staff that are using the software management have different dashboards to kind of oversee, you know, operation and kind of make sure that everything's going well but by and large underwriters\n1735000, 1752000, or the users. Typically, there is a submission flow coming in, and that will either go through, you know, clearing and be assigned to underwriters or that will come you know directly from the email inbox or portal into co pilot and then be assigned to\n1752000, 1754000, underwriters.\n1754000, 1766000, So, generally, kind of that initial triage assessment evaluation phase is all done in co pilot varies by client in terms of how specifically rating is done.\n1766000, 1777000, Some clients have kind of dedicated models or spreadsheets or report over they kind of punch in numbers and that generates the rate.", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 1, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "44c83839-e8af-46b4-998f-e60040e56c6d", "node_info": {"start": 13562, "end": 28192}}, "7326667864837873280": {"text": "using the software management have different dashboards to kind of oversee, you know, operation and kind of make sure that everything's going well but by and large underwriters\n1735000, 1752000, or the users.

Increasingly some clients are looking to move their reading into co pilot.\n1777000, 1788000, And then back it's the point where you're actually issuing a quote, we don't do any of the paper generation we don't do any of the actual kind of billing and policy.\n1788000, 1798000, It's really around that upfront underwriting process. And certainly for kind of monitoring the accounts for renewals. That's all done co pilot as well.\n1798000, 1802000, Okay, so, so\n1802000, 1808000, correspondence correspondence.\n1808000, 1811000, All of that yeah saving documents with that.\n1811000, 1817000, Correct, and referrals and collaboration around specific accounts.\n1817000, 1832000, Is that we've increasingly kind of supporting initially co pilot was more focused on actual risk selection and understanding the risk itself but especially during coven a lot of clients that hey, you know, our teams are remote.\n1832000, 1844000, We want them to be able to collaborate, you know more effective around accounts and so there are different enhancements that we've built in in order to facilitate that workflow component of it to just make everyone's lives easier and get to\n1844000, 1861000, the bottom of it. Yeah, I think that I think this is off topic here but I do think that, you know, technologies more advanced than the carriers are these days you know, generally speaking, I think carriers just in general are still trying to get the basics\n1861000, 1864000, of it. That's where a lot of opportunity resides.\n1864000, 1881000, But it's it's it's funny and so they take a really slick tool like what you probably guys have here or have built here and then they, they dummy it down if you will to fill up fills the needs of some really rudimentary things that we just have struggled with as a, as a, as an industry\n1881000, 1891000, at the time right which is a, which is a good thing but it's because it makes your tool or comprehensive but it's it's always interesting because that's the same challenge we face right so.\n1891000, 1906000, So, cool. I can imagine for sure I mean carriers realistically have so many things that they're kind of blocking and tackling and managing and developing kind of world class software is not a core.\n1906000, 1918000, They're also you know managing kind of multiple integrations and legacy systems and so it's really hard to get the cutting edge when you're just trying to catch up and kind of get things to keep the lights on.\n1918000, 1927000, We come in companies like us in order to basically you know partner and support that.\n1927000, 1937000, So we started a very pragmatic way, so our clients will use the copilot software out of the box about any need for integration we can plug in this submission inbox and kind of a start using copilot.\n1937000, 1951000, Gradually our clients I hate you know actually it'd be helpful to view our, our kind of book, you know losses and copilot would be helpful if we can actually add these additional modeling components to copilot and so as we deepen our relationship with\n1951000, 1964000, clients and we support additional kind of integrations and really help them manage some of their internal data as well. Sure. Yeah, makes sense. What are. So you were asking about rules earlier so are those used to help the AI.\n1964000, 1972000, And where you guys do anything with appetite or or or guidelines specifically or not so much.\n1972000, 1987000, Yeah, I mean it's it's really helping you know our focus is on helping our clients insurers make sure that they are writing the right risks. And so, that starts off with, you know, what do they want to write versus what they're actually writing right now and helping to\n1987000, 1999000, you know, bridge that gap. So, when we start off we'll say hey, why don't you send us your renewal book for the next month or the next quarter. Let's run it through copilot and actually see what copilot tells us.\n1999000, 2009000, And oftentimes there are 25% of the risks that are just completely out of appetite, it should have never been written, you want to get off of them as soon as possible.\n2009000, 2022000, Another 10 15% that actually probably require some, you know, premium adjustments or some kind of endorsements exclusions. And so without actually, you know, changing fundamentally how they think about risk.\n2022000, 2033000, It's just like let's cross the keys and dot the eyes on things that you already want to be doing and you're not currently doing because underwriters are just stretched.\n2033000, 2043000, Even if you had, you know, large battery of underwriters with a lot of time, they wouldn't necessarily be able to kind of uncover all the insights that we're bringing forth through that.\n2043000, 2055000, So, that's kind of one component of just like, let's actually make sure that you are focusing on opportunities that you want your directors to focus on and writing the risk that you want.\n2055000, 2072000, Yeah, it makes sense. I mean, the reality is every talk to 100 underwriters every writer will have a different way of how they underwrite. Right. So, when you standardize it and have a system help guide it right I mean it's it's much easier to say, or get some consistency\n2072000, 2088000, in the interpretation of underwriting because it is great. Right. So, but it sounds like when you do that renewal ingestion or kind of batch process, you're doing that based on some sort of rules or guidelines that the carrier your partner would would provide you that\n2088000, 2106000, you use to map against the risk serve. Yeah, and it varies in terms of level of sophistication so we're meeting clients kind of where they are there are some clients that we, you know, like hospitality and we like restaurants but we don't like, you know,\n2106000, 2119000, childcare and we don't like education, and they're getting submissions across the whole spectrum, and it may be an underwriter five minutes to realize like, I have no business looking at this because I can't even write it, you don't want it.\n2119000, 2136000, So, that's the highest level of kind of aggregation, going down into different class codes that you know are acceptable or not acceptable and that may vary by state going down into, okay, you know we do like, you know, landscapers will we don't want landscapers who chopped\n2136000, 2139000, down trees. That's a very different you know exposure.\n2139000, 2151000, So, the more nuanced that is there the more nuanced we're able to kind of embed in co pilot. Yep, make sure that the right underwriters are spending their time on what's actually available.\n2151000, 2154000, That makes sense.\n2154000, 2172000, And so, as you kind of think about some of the, you know, the near term objectives that your underwriters are kind of executing against or their specific things that are kind of being emphasized to them in terms of, hey, you know, we are trying to improve our risk\n2172000, 2188000, collection and these classes, or trying to make sure that we at least have a first glimpse at all risks versus you know we've seen many cases where they're just, you know, some submissions that never get touched because there isn't bandwidth for that and\n2188000, 2196000, therefore that you know, perhaps is missed opportunity for risks that could have been worthwhile.\n2196000, 2210000, I would, I would say yeah I mean that's most certainly a need for that today. We probably don't know what we don't know right just because of our data living in three different systems and some of our data not even making the system.\n2210000, 2222000, I don't have a clear line of sight into, you know, we prep everything so we have underwriting coordinators that are like a reader or processor.\n2222000, 2227000, It's funny Jen popped up in my, my elbow there.\n2227000, 2241000, And they prep so we have, you know, they go out, pull the website they pull E-mod information that they prep a lot of files but that, you know, how many of those files made it to the underwriter and the underwriter never actually had capacity to vet out that\n2241000, 2252000, one opportunity versus they did and they just passed on it. You know, we don't have a robust enough platform today.\n2252000, 2259000, Pulling all that so we should take experience together to really analyze the data to the level you're speaking of.\n2259000, 2275000, And, you know, ideally, right, as we, as we build out our guide where it works come solution.\n2275000, 2293000, And leveraging, you know, pricing model where where appropriate and so some things, you know, we're going to design rules that say hey if it's this class code if it's the mods less than this right, you know, the very basic stuff.\n2293000, 2321000, We'll not even give it to an underwriter right but then once it gets to an underwriter, how competent am I in that they're, that they're looking at them all not very confident how confident am I in that they are looking at them in a similar lens, not very confident right I mean if you, if you, Alaska National, the company that we purchased their, their, their model was hey submit everything to us we'll underwrite it right they didn't have appetite so they have guidelines.\n2321000, 2333000, That's all foreign to that that underwriting team and so it was more around how can we, how can we crack the code where other carriers can't write every other carriers declining your logistics business.\n2333000, 2343000, Well, let me let me look at that and pick the cherry out of the out of the group and partner with Yana and write that and be profitable together and so.\n2343000, 2355000, Again, that's just where today, we're pretty green as we build out our integration and really standardized who we want to be and how do we manage our appetite guidelines rules, all that type of stuff.\n2355000, 2361000, We're just now in the process of kind of trying to set that up so makes sense and.\n2361000, 2372000, And one thing that we also observe is that, you know, you talked to you mentioned that you talked to each underwriter and they'll give you somewhat of a different answer in a different perspective.\n2372000, 2386000, Underwriter is or, you know, when constrained they'll oftentimes look at kind of just a set or sampling of the states in which a business operates or subset of some sort of employees to kind of you know spot check.\n2386000, 2397000, But often, you know, if you have the ability to actually know, we know the technology capability look at all of them, then you can surface things as the underwriter just like wouldn't pick up on.\n2397000, 2415000, And so that that's another thing that we see if you have a, you know, a property exposure reliability exposure and the underwriters only looking at the kind of three largest payroll locations or the two highest QV locate the ID locations.\n2415000, 2422000, They're spot chatting checking but but actually what they should be doing if they have the abilities is looking at the whole exposure.\n2422000, 2425000, Yeah, something that they were able to help you.\n2425000, 2436000, I wonder in particular on the kind of non comp book that you guys are looking to grow is that probably like a $1520 million book right now.\n2436000, 2443000, Good question. I mean, it's probably more sizable that I guess it's probably about $100 million.\n2443000, 2451000, And it's. So I might have been a little short change that it's by, you know, somewhere around 10 to 15% of our portfolio.\n2451000, 2463000, Alaska, Alaska National, obviously the company so we have a high market share there in the state of Alaska, and then in the PNW, mostly Washington.\n2463000, 2480000, Obviously, Washington doesn't have workers conference monolithic state and so we write a fair amount of other lines there as well. A lot of it's big hairy stuff right I mean it's it's, you know, like I said earlier, logistics firm that, you know, is\n2480000, 2502000, a couple hundred vehicle fleet trucking operation right a lot of like, we in Alaska we write a lot of tough stuff like marine operations and, you know, just stuff stuff that, you know, it because it's hairier we're spending a lot of time\n2502000, 2518000, putting boots on the ground and actually put eyes on the risk right there. The average premium up there is probably, you know, north of Washington is north of 100,000 where it makes sense to deploy resources like that and then in Alaska.\n2518000, 2527000, You know it's smaller policies but we tend to lost control a lot of risks up there.\n2527000, 2532000, So, it's perfect sense.\n2532000, 2543000, This has been very helpful hopefully this gave you a high level overview I realized that somewhat you know this an abstract discussion hard to perhaps visualize.\n2543000, 2552000, I guess I look to you what would be most helpful in terms of next step as it relates to kind of the things that you're prioritizing and executing against.\n2552000, 2567000, So, you guys taking the time I mean Alan spoke highly of you guys I'm a big Alan fan of known him for a long time and obviously wanted to at least get to know one another for future discussion it is something that's on my mind, right.\n2567000, 2584000, It doesn't make sense to me that we are, you know, aren't able to do a lot of year over year analysis on our submissions because our documentation is on an Excel spreadsheet that sits on someone's desktop I mean there's just a lot of standardization and data\n2584000, 2601000, that can take place with utilizing a tool like yours.\n2601000, 2619000, So, there's probably less value there versus the other lines, etc. And so it's definitely something that's on my mind and I appreciate the introduction and I would just ask, you know, let's stay connected and see how time progresses but I do feel like", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 2, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "44c83839-e8af-46b4-998f-e60040e56c6d", "node_info": {"start": 28169, "end": 42763}}, "8106460922068977197": {"text": "a big Alan fan of known him for a long time and obviously wanted to at least get to know one another for future discussion it is something that's on my mind, right.\n2567000, 2584000, It doesn't make sense to me that we are, you know, aren't able to do a lot of year over year analysis on our submissions because our documentation is on an Excel spreadsheet that sits on someone's desktop I mean there's just a lot of standardization and data\n2584000, 2601000, that can take place with utilizing a tool like yours.\n2601000, 2619000, So, there's probably less value there versus the other lines, etc. And so it's definitely something that's on my mind and I appreciate the introduction and I would just ask, you know, let's stay connected and see how time progresses but I do feel like I need to get some of my, my basic\n2619000, 2633000, ducks in a row before I can really lay out the roadmap of, you know, hey, here's the gap. And let's figure out who can help build a gap. And at that point, it would be probably more appropriate discussion right.\n2633000, 2640000, Yeah, that's totally fair seems like you have some kind of basic meat and potatoes you want to solve.\n2640000, 2651000, And I think in terms of, you know, guide wire word of caution we've had you know all of our clients use either guide wire or duck creek or some other system.\n2651000, 2677000, And we've promised them you know underwriting workbench and underwriting insights and cognitive analytics and all these fancy names. And what ends up happening is that like it takes four to five years to implement and it, it doesn't solve the underwriters problem and it doesn't actually help them make better\n2677000, 2693000, policies but very different offering than we have. So, what I would say is, you know, when, when you deem it to be relevant and helpful. What we can do is actually walk through a demo together of co pilot and usually what we find helpful our clients find helpful is actually\n2693000, 2722000, taking in a handful of submissions that are currently kind of being worked on by your underwriters new business or renewals will kind of run them through copilot is walk through life together that oftentimes helps to bring into life in terms of like okay wow, you know, I would not have, you know, understood that prior to writing this, I would either have to cancel the policy or completely kind of change the premium and the client might cancel, or I risk you know, you know, incurring a loss that that would you know make this unprofitable for the next 100 years.\n2722000, 2747000, So, would you say that. Yeah, just just so I get clear yeah that's one last piece I'm sorry that I have to jump I have a lot of 15 but, of course, so would you say that the workflow, you know, do you guys have some of that in there so like queue management ability to send a task between users, you know, kind of date stamp timestamping those transactions as they change hands etc so all that live in there as well.\n2747000, 2752000, It does. We have. Yeah, okay. That's helpful.\n2752000, 2767000, I appreciate it Danny I'd say let's let's reconnect here in a couple months just do a quick check in, because I do think things are going to move and I want to, I want to start, you know, as we strategically think through pricing tools and how we're, you know, visualizing those bringing up together I do think,\n2767000, 2785000, you know, having a place is important to tie a lot of this stuff together, right, and I am trying to think through different options and solutions that can help do that in the most, you know, cost effective way with with ease of maintenance in mind right and all that good stuff and so I really appreciate the conversation\n2785000, 2796000, today. Of course yeah I mean our core value proposition is better risk selection and more profitable underwriting and certainly anything that comes along with that in terms of supporting underwriters, helping manage the flow.\n2796000, 2805000, We're all for it so thank you again Mark.

Okay.\n95000, 110000, Okay.\n110000, 115000, Recording.\n115000, 117000, Hello there. Good afternoon.\n117000, 119000, Hey Danny.\n119000, 120000, How are you?\n120000, 122000, Well, how are you today, Mark?\n122000, 123000, Good. Yeah.\n123000, 125000, So, you're in Phoenix?\n125000, 126000, Yeah.\n126000, 127000, Yep.\n127000, 128000, Since March.\n128000, 131000, So prior to that, I was in California.\n131000, 132000, Prior.\n132000, 135000, I've been, I've been in quite a few states, but yeah.\n135000, 137000, So right now family and I live in Phoenix.\n137000, 138000, So.\n138000, 139000, Nice.\n139000, 141000, For everyone.\n141000, 142000, Good. Yeah.\n142000, 146000, We were, we were in Northern LA.\n146000, 150000, And that's called thousand Oaks.\n150000, 154000, And we were able to secure a home out here, which was nice.\n154000, 156000, And so everything's been good.\n156000, 158000, Just, you know, we're used to moving.\n158000, 168000, So we've moved from Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Texas, twice, California, twice, Arizona, New Jersey, O'Boken.\n168000, 171000, We've been quite a few states.\n171000, 175000, So we're, we're fairly familiar with the strategy on how to move efficiently.\n175000, 176000, So.\n176000, 177000, Nice.\n177000, 182000, And that's on that latest move. And I feel like that, that experience is certainly eyeopening for the family.\n182000, 187000, Hopefully the kids get to meet new people and kind of experience.\n187000, 188000, Yeah.\n188000, 195000, Now the game plan was always to move and they grew as long as we could.\n195000, 202000, And then once the kids started to get to a point where, you know, school and friends became more material, we tried to slow it down.\n202000, 206000, But they're four right now. So they got twin boys. They just started preschool.\n206000, 212000, So we still got, we can potentially do a few more moves if we need to.\n212000, 215000, Well, Phoenix is a great area. So hopefully it's cooling down now.\n215000, 219000, And yeah, it is. It's great right now. Yeah. It's just starting to cool down.\n219000, 221000, So how about you guys? Where are you at?\n221000, 227000, We're both based in New York. So our offices are in Manhattan and I live in Brooklyn, Paul lives in Manhattan.\n227000, 230000, Okay, cool.\n230000, 236000, I was fortunate to spend a month with family out in Phoenix last summer.\n236000, 244000, And so I've always been kind of in and out for different like work trips. We never really got to spend time there. So I enjoyed it.\n244000, 249000, Yeah, so far so good. I mean, we've really enjoyed it.\n249000, 267000, The we got here out in March of this year. So we went through the summer. So now it is it is cooling down. I think today's a high of 82, which is amazing. So now it's getting to be weather where, you know, I can get back outside and start jogging again and doing some outdoor activities.\n267000, 277000, But I mean, it wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. But I did hear this was a lighter year for for the heat. So we'll we'll see how it looks next year.\n277000, 289000, Makes makes good sense. Well, thank you for taking the time to chat and I know some time in the works. Certainly, Alan Driscoll spoke highly of you and thought it'd be worthwhile for us to connect.\n289000, 298000, So learn a little bit more about you know, and copper coin and tell you a little bit more about our co pilot and see what would be most helpful.\n298000, 302000, Yeah, sounds like strategy where you guys want to start off.\n302000, 315000, Sure. So happy to give you kind of a high level overview of but it might be helpful also to understand a little bit more kind of work your priorities and yeah, customized kind of the discussion from there.\n315000, 332000, Yes, my background always have been in underwriting always PNC multi line underwriting not so much on the specialty or professional line side of the house more more traditional multi line package business.\n332000, 349000, So I was a copper point back in July of 19 was responsible for underwriting for the western region and then recently took a new role in April this year so a little bit about copper point so cover point.\n349000, 367000, The legacy state funds was privatized back in July or July I don't know what month it was but 2013 let's go with that. And really at that point, you know became less, no longer the state fund and really needed to stand on their own and start to develop\n367000, 369000, their strategy.\n369000, 373000, The CEO here is a gentleman named Mark Schmillen.\n373000, 386000, And he came to us from travelers he's been with the group for about five years. And, you know, really set the group on a journey to become a billion dollar plus carrier right and.\n386000, 403000, And so, the state fund, I don't know if you know a ton about how state funds operate but you know you're more or less the, the, the provider for all insurance needs to the state and it's less about underwriting or, or, or, you know, thinking through the profit\n403000, 413000, and loss it's more about just servicing and and and quoting without much underwriting judgment or or philosophy if you will so.\n413000, 418000, So, copper point was privatized.\n418000, 424000, 2015 we're 2016 we're probably around 300 million in premium.\n424000, 430000, That was, that was back in the day before workers comp rates have really declined.\n430000, 445000, And part of the big strategy was to grow through acquisitions and so in 2019, or, excuse me, end of 2017 they purchased a company called Pacific comp, which was a standalone work operator in the state of California.\n445000, 454000, With that obviously came roughly 170 million in premium came with them a distribution in the state of California.\n454000, 474000, And then shortly thereafter about a year later they acquired Alaska national, which was which was a pretty instrumental instrumental strategic purchase for us and Alaska national very service oriented organization but they they with a lot of workers\n474000, 485000, comp expertise but they also brought state expansion. So, copper point and Pacific comp were really kind of the southwest states if you will.\n485000, 500000, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, California, and then Alaska national brought 26 state filings and multi line PNC filings across all 26 states.\n500000, 518000, And so, you know, with that it really is allowing us to start position ourselves with who do we want to be in the future right so today we're 80% may maybe closer to 90% rate premium is standalone workers comp, and 10% comes from other lines other PNC lines,\n518000, 521000, and, you know, into the future.\n521000, 536000, I would like to see that probably closer to like a 2080. In the next few years, but it's going to take some time and so anyway so back to my role so three companies coming together three relatively smaller companies right Alaska nationals 250 million.\n536000, 552000, So the comp again around 170 and the copper point was like 250 300. And everyone managed things differently everyone, you know, the field managed a lot of their, you know, making filing decisions product decisions service decisions.\n552000, 570000, And so, through bringing three companies together, obviously a lot of integration efforts are taking place, and a need for a new role stood up and are introduced itself and so I took a role for on ready systems and product back in April and so my responsibility\n570000, 582000, was to serve as the enterprise voice for you know what technology what systems do we need to drive the strategy from our underwriting standpoint, which really is all policy if you will.\n582000, 593000, And then, and then also things like customer maintenance, so things like Salesforce those those would fall under my umbrella really the tools and technology.\n593000, 604000, So it's customer base, if you will. And then, so within that it's policy I got digital, I've got Salesforce, or tools like that.\n604000, 617000, And so right now we have multiple policy systems across the enterprise we have multiple supporting products across the enterprise and so we're looking to start to, you know, come up with a vision of what does that look like going forward.\n617000, 629000, So that's one piece and then the other is product, I'm responsible for so that's, you know, product research product development maintenance of products doing filings keeping up with circulars, etc.\n629000, 646000, So, yeah, so that's, that's my role and so it's been going since about April, and right now the journey is just really kind of getting the basics or the fundamentals in place so instead of three people managing circulars, you know, having one group manage\n646000, 659000, circulars and do it across all systems, instead of, you know, three ways of it taking or submitting tickets for, you know, backlog enhancements etc having one process.\n659000, 667000, And so we're just kind of building out our, who we are, how do we work type of a mentality.\n667000, 681000, And, and, and just to be clear my team is not responsible for it, we're not responsible for the actual maintenance development we're casting the vision and partnering with our partners to bring it to life right so.\n681000, 686000, That's a, that's a long overview but hopefully gave you guys good insights.\n686000, 700000, Yeah, certainly very helpful appreciate that that comprehensive overview and it seems like in many ways, you're taking three kind of legacy platforms three legacy operations are really unifying them so that carport one is better positioned for the future\n700000, 707000, and that spans kind of the whole gamut of different operational components and underwriting support etc.\n707000, 719000, Yeah, I mean it's it's it's happening across all our enterprise so it's operations, right, how do we standardize that it's standard standing up an EDW right i mean it's everyone's going through integration.\n719000, 733000, I'm responsible for the systems and, and as it relates to underwriting as well as the product side. So, makes a lot of sense and I would wonder as you kind of think about some of the key business metrics and KPIs that you guys are excellent against.\n733000, 751000, What are some of the key objectives in terms of underwriting kind of profitability and premium birth obviously mentioned the vision of getting to $1 billion in premium I guess you guys are probably three quarters or so the way there but wonder if they're also kind of objectives\n751000, 758000, around improving loss ratio and kind of combined ratio and how that fits into what you guys are tackling day to day.\n758000, 774000, Right, we try to establish KPIs right we try to establish any strategic direction that we go to what are we going to measure ourselves against right what did we define if we achieved it or not right so anything that we can measure we try to, you know,\n774000, 792000, we're going to take it to, you know, rate retention, hit ratios quote ratios flow metrics we've we've went through the process of kind of outlining an ideal state of portfolio KPIs needed to effectively manage the business with drill down capabilities, etc.\n792000, 797000, So that's more like a PNL owner level if you will.\n797000, 810000, We're just, you know, today, we intake business differently right where in Alaska National League, they track business on Excel spreadsheets they don't put it in a policy system so you can't do flow metrics right.\n810000, 829000, We've got an ideal state of what PNL owners are going to be responsible for and what they need actual implementation of that is going to take time just because our data is fairly fractured our our different differs by entity obviously and then, you know,\n829000, 843000, we always have specific goals whether it's rate retention, new business hit ratios, new business ratings renewal retention rounding out business growth and certain verticals right.\n843000, 847000, We try and establish a lot of those as well.\n847000, 862000, You know, and we kind of take the approach of manage the goals to the level we can write and so if they become something where yeah I can give you my, your team's overall rate objective will target that for the team we might not be able to isolate that to the\n862000, 864000, individual's desk right.\n864000, 866000, Like that.\n866000, 879000, That's certainly helpful and if I recall correctly the the last year of your premium is comp, you guys are continuing to expand additional product lines I guess part of the regional expansion as well.\n879000, 897000, Yeah, so, yes, we just went through a five year pro forma, where we're really, you know, talking about what's our organic growth strategy, non M&A, and what does that mean for, you know, bringing other lines to our to try and round out our workers\n897000, 909000, and our comms solutions what does it mean to our state footprint and where do we want to have, you know, boots on the ground versus a, just a digital presence.\n909000, 925000, And so, yep, we're going through all of that, you know, I would say for the foreseeable future, our focus is going to be on our kind of 10 Western states, which is Alaska, Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, those kind of states, if you will, that\n925000, 929000, will start to drift over towards the Midwest.\n929000, 940000, But you know, a big believer in again doing, doing the basics really well executing well on those and there's a lot of market share potential in the current states that we, we penetrate.\n940000, 946000, Yeah, expansion, expansion is on the horizon just a little ways out.\n946000, 955000, That makes perfect sense so that's that's very helpful context and to give you kind of a high level sense for Aleppo.\n955000, 968000, Paul and I started the company about three years ago, really with the objective of empowering underwriters to achieve superior outcomes and the way that we do that is primarily through a software as a service capability called co pilot, which\n968000, 984000, helps underwriters make underwriting decisions, and that breaks down into kind of a few sub components in terms of how we're helping them to select better risk how we're helping them to prioritize their time and focus on kind of the best opportunities but ultimately\n984000, 1000000, what we see is across, across carrier is underwriters are pulled into pretty opposing directions on the one hand they're kind of asked to be very fast and very efficient in terms of getting quotes out to brokers and maintaining those relationships, essentially\n1000000, 1012000, you know saying yes wherever possible to grow premium. On the other hand, they're actually being told hey, you guys are the last kind of guardians of the quality of the book, we need to make sure that we're being, you know, very thoughtful and following\n1012000, 1020000, our guidelines and being very thorough and selecting risk. And so they're constantly, you know, toggling back between the two of those.\n1020000, 1033000, That actually through through, you know, co pilot, we can help to reconcile those and actually help underwriters do better on both dimensions. And so that's really been the focus we've been deployed at handful of largest carriers in the US and\n1033000, 1047000, continuing to grow very rapidly. And basically, you know, our clients have their submission flow flow into our co pilot software, the software helps to triage and focus the time on where they'll be actually get the biggest bang for their buck.\n1047000, 1059000, And then ultimately give them the insights that they need to know, powered by AI powered by kind of data in order to really kind of make a smarter decision use their underwriting discretion in the most effective way.\n1059000, 1072000, Yeah, voting faster, putting the right business. It's a declination get that out quickly so you can both move on and good partner to the broker. So that's kind of the 40,000.\n1072000, 1083000, I think I'm actually I mean so interesting enough I was talking to a software provider that I think probably does similar to what you're you're mentioning.\n1083000, 1089000, I called it an underwriting workbench I don't think that they liked it.\n1089000, 1102000, Because I think, you know, the reality of the tools that you guys are bringing to the table are much more dynamic and much more, you know, capable than just an underwriting workbench or workstation right.\n1102000, 1109000, But, you know, what I, what I had articulated on that conversation was that,\n1109000, 1125000, they were talking about rules and, you know, hey, imagine being able to manage your, your property capacity much more sophisticated right. So if you wanted to say, hey, in this specific territory, I need more rate or you can't write more than X amount of premium, etc.\n1125000, 1141000, You could build that rule in that it would feature underwriter, etc. And as a, as they deal through, you know, submission flow that it would, it would systematically help prioritize you know where it sits in the, in the kind of hopper if you will based on the rules, etc.\n1141000, 1170000, And, you know, where my needs are today, you know, the tools that folks like, you know, you're mine, I'm kind of just speaking in general terms I hope you don't take this to you guys specifically because, like you said, you only gave me the 40,000 foot level, you know, where you guys, where I struggle today is at the very, very basics of insurance 101 right so you talked about appetite, you know, we don't have a, a, a enterprise.\n1170000, 1183000, Enterprise wide appetite today, I mean we do but it's very generic it's, you know, red, yellow, green by by workers comp class code it's not, you know, if this is an excavator.\n1183000, 1198000, These are the types of things that you should look for you shouldn't look for or maybe minimum premiums associated with it or or guidelines or rules specifically around territories or deployment of property capacity or cat modeling, etc.\n1198000, 1201000, We're very rudimentary.\n1201000, 1204000, At this point and kind of that infrastructure.\n1204000, 1222000, And so I'm in the process of trying to build all that but it's going to be, it's going to be a journey and, you know, right now we're just trying to do the crosswalk between, you know, nakes code versus sick code versus ISO CGL versus WC IRB versus NCCI so that we can have a better way of managing appetite.\n1222000, 1230000, Designing a system that actually can adjust that and rules around that etc. Right now we're just starting to think through that.\n1230000, 1247000, But where we break down today is really more like in, in the basics of just workflow, right, and, you know, one of the the platforms that we have is guide where guide where as a policy system does things really good but what it doesn't do great is is, you know, workflow,\n1247000, 1256000, and, you know, being able to kind of manage monitor the handoffs from, you know, hey, this was submitted to me.\n1256000, 1266000, Now I went out got additional information now I passed it back to my underwriter my underwriter now has been there to, you know, they release a quote.\n1266000, 1276000, Now it actually shows status it says it's been released etc right and so they the workflow is a big gap that we're feeling right now.\n1276000, 1297000, And so, you know, as well as just being on multiple policy systems right and so guide wire is is in a lot of ways, what we're building towards for the future for workers comp we're still exploring the PNC lines and what makes best sense there for our policy system but anyway so yeah I think I've ever heard of a company called Federado.\n1297000, 1306000, Right.\n1306000, 1315000, That's the, that's the company I was mentioning there earlier but is that a general kind of overview of the tool like would you call it an underwriting workstation or how would you describe it I guess.\n1315000, 1333000, I mean I understand that you were characterized in an underwriter workbench or workstation around kind of rules and you know sorting and the like. That's probably a very small component of what co pilot does and co pilot is really moving beyond those those static roles.\n1333000, 1349000, You know when you manage the business and too much of a rigid way there are kind of too many exceptions too many things that don't fit. And therefore it all just piles up on the underwriters kind of lap. And I guess I'd wonder, you know, what is the overall submission flow that you guys are seeing\n1349000, 1357000, right now is there a certain volume that you're kind of receiving in terms of inbound submissions and how do you anticipate that background.\n1357000, 1366000, Yeah, we probably I mean enterprise wide we probably get somewhere around 20,000 submissions a year in the state of California alone we probably get 15,000.\n1366000, 1372000, And I would anticipate that only to go upward, you know, based on our partnerships.\n1372000, 1389000, We are, we do business with limited and preferred distribution channels so we're not out talking to every single brokerage and retailer we select who we want to partner with and it's based on having a sizeable mature partnership and relationship and so.\n1389000, 1402000, You know as our strategy changes as our, as our product offering grows etc in the future we would anticipate you know more and more submission flow to come. Now that being said, you know the marketplace has changed a lot.\n1402000, 1420000, And because of efficiencies and, you know, upload capabilities and OCR functionality I mean, you know, most broker partners, block the market right I mean you get a lot of submissions just because they don't want someone else to come in and snipe, snipe them\n1420000, 1432000, and, you know, try and chase them down that that that had a just a block that it wouldn't have been this right so not every submission we receive is a viable opportunity for sure.\n1432000, 1438000, And how many underwriters you have to work through that, that overall flow.\n1438000, 1443000, Good question so we probably got.\n1443000, 1450000, So we probably have about 55 underwriters.\n1450000, 1455000, Probably a mix of underwriters and assistant underwriters and kind of like.\n1455000, 1477000, I think that's probably mostly just underwriters, you know, we're very hands on service based organization and so, but also we're still dealing on Excel spreadsheets right so it's a fairly manual process today and so we do have, you know, a fairly\n1477000, 1493000, I mean, you know, with the manual load we have to staff obviously according to support that and so we have, I would guess we have probably like a two to one ratio right now, every two underwriters one AU.\n1493000, 1504000, And then with workers, I mean I'm sure you know this, you know, workers copy don't really need like a reader or someone in processing I mean it's a pretty standard.\n1504000, 1515000, Yeah, I mean it's pretty straightforward, and you know so we do have some readers, obviously that support the PNC lines where it's much more complicated submission and take and and quote process.\n1515000, 1522000, But for workers comp, usually the use or the agent just upload to the our portal.\n1522000, 1536000, Makes perfect sense and one thing that we commonly see is that organizations are just, you know, constrained as many underwriters as they have there's always just a ton of work to get done and so either you're kind of getting through the volume, but you're\n1536000, 1546000, cutting corners and underwriters are just not being as thorough and they may make you know, make pretty large mistakes which can be very costly in terms of dissipated losses.\n1546000, 1555000, On the other hand, they can kind of go into the nitty gritty and and they may just take way too long to quote and then miss opportunities and that's that's all kind of missed opportunity.\n1555000, 1571000, So the question is, how can you actually get the most out of your underwriting staff and ultimately what we see is that underwriters end up either, you know, wasting time on submissions that that never end up coding or that quote and have very low likelihood of\n1571000, 1573000, binding.\n1573000, 1588000, It doesn't fit in the box that we're looking for, or the burpers are spraying and praying and kind of wasting our time if we've seen this risk for the last four years and you know we always quote and never binds and probably don't want to waste time on it\n1588000, 1589000, this year.\n1589000, 1604000, And so really helping underwriters first of all understand kind of which opportunities are actually good ones. That's something that we can do in kind of an automated scalable way using that AI, and then with underwriter feedback observing their behavior that\n1604000, 1618000, consistently improves. And then really importantly when an underwriter is actually looking at a given risk, one thing that we see is that, you know, even if they're not working with with spreadsheets per se there's still a ton of manual work that they need to do.\n1618000, 1632000, They need to kind of go online to check you know what is the, you know, loss history and you look at news articles they might look at the business and see their customer reviews or their employee reviews, and all of that in order to kind of get the necessary data points\n1632000, 1637000, in order to develop a perspective and make a decision.\n1637000, 1652000, And so the perspective is that actually a lot of that is stuff that we can collect and make inferences on and actually present the underwriter with this is what you need to know about this risk. Let's say this is a contractor they you know they say that they don't do roofing\n1652000, 1653000, work.\n1653000, 1666000, They say they do roofing they're going to get charged more broker advised and that such, but actually, you know, software went through 300 customer reviews about this business and actually finds that seven people said, Oh, this contractor did a great job installing\n1666000, 1680000, solar panels on my roof well clearly do some roofing work and maybe there are another 20 permits for roofing you know installation in the county like Department of Buildings. Hey underwriter like this doesn't quite add up.\n1680000, 1683000, You should, you know, follow up on this. Yeah.\n1683000, 1695000, So, there won't be a scenario where you see a claim come in you know with an employee falling off the roof. If you're actually doing that proper dating upfront and understanding exactly.\n1695000, 1705000, Yeah, no, it makes a lot of sense. So, I mean, I guess just high level, you know who all plays in your tool right so is it specifically an underwriter tool only.\n1705000, 1718000, And then, you know, kind of where do you see an underwriter start with your with the deployments that you've done so far, you know, where do you see an underwriter start engaging your tool versus stop engaging your tool right so within a submission lifecycle\n1718000, 1720000, experience.\n1720000, 1735000, Well, all good questions. So generally it's underwriters and some support staff that are using the software management have different dashboards to kind of oversee, you know, operation and kind of make sure that everything's going well but by and large underwriters\n1735000, 1752000, or the users. Typically, there is a submission flow coming in, and that will either go through, you know, clearing and be assigned to underwriters or that will come you know directly from the email inbox or portal into co pilot and then be assigned to\n1752000, 1754000, underwriters.\n1754000, 1766000, So, generally, kind of that initial triage assessment evaluation phase is all done in co pilot varies by client in terms of how specifically rating is done.\n1766000, 1777000, Some clients have kind of dedicated models or spreadsheets or report over they kind of punch in numbers and that generates the rate. Increasingly some clients are looking to move their reading into co pilot.\n1777000, 1788000, And then back it's the point where you're actually issuing a quote, we don't do any of the paper generation we don't do any of the actual kind of billing and policy.\n1788000, 1798000, It's really around that upfront underwriting process. And certainly for kind of monitoring the accounts for renewals. That's all done co pilot as well.\n1798000, 1802000, Okay, so, so\n1802000, 1808000, correspondence correspondence.\n1808000, 1811000, All of that yeah saving documents with that.\n1811000, 1817000, Correct, and referrals and collaboration around specific accounts.\n1817000, 1832000, Is that we've increasingly kind of supporting initially co pilot was more focused on actual risk selection and understanding the risk itself but especially during coven a lot of clients that hey, you know, our teams are remote.\n1832000, 1844000, We want them to be able to collaborate, you know more effective around accounts and so there are different enhancements that we've built in in order to facilitate that workflow component of it to just make everyone's lives easier and get to\n1844000, 1861000, the bottom of it. Yeah, I think that I think this is off topic here but I do think that, you know, technologies more advanced than the carriers are these days you know, generally speaking, I think carriers just in general are still trying to get the basics\n1861000, 1864000, of it. That's where a lot of opportunity resides.\n1864000, 1881000, But it's it's it's funny and so they take a really slick tool like what you probably guys have here or have built here and then they, they dummy it down if you will to fill up fills the needs of some really rudimentary things that we just have struggled with as a, as a, as an industry\n1881000, 1891000, at the time right which is a, which is a good thing but it's because it makes your tool or comprehensive but it's it's always interesting because that's the same challenge we face right so.\n1891000, 1906000, So, cool. I can imagine for sure I mean carriers realistically have so many things that they're kind of blocking and tackling and managing and developing kind of world class software is not a core.\n1906000, 1918000, They're also you know managing kind of multiple integrations and legacy systems and so it's really hard to get the cutting edge when you're just trying to catch up and kind of get things to keep the lights on.\n1918000, 1927000, We come in companies like us in order to basically you know partner and support that.\n1927000, 1937000, So we started a very pragmatic way, so our clients will use the copilot software out of the box about any need for integration we can plug in this submission inbox and kind of a start using copilot.\n1937000, 1951000, Gradually our clients I hate you know actually it'd be helpful to view our, our kind of book, you know losses and copilot would be helpful if we can actually add these additional modeling components to copilot and so as we deepen our relationship with\n1951000, 1964000, clients and we support additional kind of integrations and really help them manage some of their internal data as well. Sure. Yeah, makes sense. What are. So you were asking about rules earlier so are those used to help the AI.\n1964000, 1972000, And where you guys do anything with appetite or or or guidelines specifically or not so much.\n1972000, 1987000, Yeah, I mean it's it's really helping you know our focus is on helping our clients insurers make sure that they are writing the right risks. And so, that starts off with, you know, what do they want to write versus what they're actually writing right now and helping to\n1987000, 1999000, you know, bridge that gap. So, when we start off we'll say hey, why don't you send us your renewal book for the next month or the next quarter. Let's run it through copilot and actually see what copilot tells us.\n1999000, 2009000, And oftentimes there are 25% of the risks that are just completely out of appetite, it should have never been written, you want to get off of them as soon as possible.\n2009000, 2022000, Another 10 15% that actually probably require some, you know, premium adjustments or some kind of endorsements exclusions. And so without actually, you know, changing fundamentally how they think about risk.\n2022000, 2033000, It's just like let's cross the keys and dot the eyes on things that you already want to be doing and you're not currently doing because underwriters are just stretched.\n2033000, 2043000, Even if you had, you know, large battery of underwriters with a lot of time, they wouldn't necessarily be able to kind of uncover all the insights that we're bringing forth through that.\n2043000, 2055000, So, that's kind of one component of just like, let's actually make sure that you are focusing on opportunities that you want your directors to focus on and writing the risk that you want.\n2055000, 2072000, Yeah, it makes sense. I mean, the reality is every talk to 100 underwriters every writer will have a different way of how they underwrite. Right. So, when you standardize it and have a system help guide it right I mean it's it's much easier to say, or get some consistency\n2072000, 2088000, in the interpretation of underwriting because it is great. Right. So, but it sounds like when you do that renewal ingestion or kind of batch process, you're doing that based on some sort of rules or guidelines that the carrier your partner would would provide you that\n2088000, 2106000, you use to map against the risk serve. Yeah, and it varies in terms of level of sophistication so we're meeting clients kind of where they are there are some clients that we, you know, like hospitality and we like restaurants but we don't like, you know,\n2106000, 2119000, childcare and we don't like education, and they're getting submissions across the whole spectrum, and it may be an underwriter five minutes to realize like, I have no business looking at this because I can't even write it, you don't want it.\n2119000, 2136000, So, that's the highest level of kind of aggregation, going down into different class codes that you know are acceptable or not acceptable and that may vary by state going down into, okay, you know we do like, you know, landscapers will we don't want landscapers who chopped\n2136000, 2139000, down trees. That's a very different you know exposure.\n2139000, 2151000, So, the more nuanced that is there the more nuanced we're able to kind of embed in co pilot. Yep, make sure that the right underwriters are spending their time on what's actually available.\n2151000, 2154000, That makes sense.\n2154000, 2172000, And so, as you kind of think about some of the, you know, the near term objectives that your underwriters are kind of executing against or their specific things that are kind of being emphasized to them in terms of, hey, you know, we are trying to improve our risk\n2172000, 2188000, collection and these classes, or trying to make sure that we at least have a first glimpse at all risks versus you know we've seen many cases where they're just, you know, some submissions that never get touched because there isn't bandwidth for that and\n2188000, 2196000, therefore that you know, perhaps is missed opportunity for risks that could have been worthwhile.\n2196000, 2210000, I would, I would say yeah I mean that's most certainly a need for that today. We probably don't know what we don't know right just because of our data living in three different systems and some of our data not even making the system.\n2210000, 2222000, I don't have a clear line of sight into, you know, we prep everything so we have underwriting coordinators that are like a reader or processor.\n2222000, 2227000, It's funny Jen popped up in my, my elbow there.\n2227000, 2241000, And they prep so we have, you know, they go out, pull the website they pull E-mod information that they prep a lot of files but that, you know, how many of those files made it to the underwriter and the underwriter never actually had capacity to vet out that\n2241000, 2252000, one opportunity versus they did and they just passed on it. You know, we don't have a robust enough platform today.\n2252000, 2259000, Pulling all that so we should take experience together to really analyze the data to the level you're speaking of.\n2259000, 2275000, And, you know, ideally, right, as we, as we build out our guide where it works come solution.\n2275000, 2293000, And leveraging, you know, pricing model where where appropriate and so some things, you know, we're going to design rules that say hey if it's this class code if it's the mods less than this right, you know, the very basic stuff.\n2293000, 2321000, We'll not even give it to an underwriter right but then once it gets to an underwriter, how competent am I in that they're, that they're looking at them all not very confident how confident am I in that they are looking at them in a similar lens, not very confident right I mean if you, if you, Alaska National, the company that we purchased their, their, their model was hey submit everything to us we'll underwrite it right they didn't have appetite so they have guidelines.\n2321000, 2333000, That's all foreign to that that underwriting team and so it was more around how can we, how can we crack the code where other carriers can't write every other carriers declining your logistics business.\n2333000, 2343000, Well, let me let me look at that and pick the cherry out of the out of the group and partner with Yana and write that and be profitable together and so.\n2343000, 2355000, Again, that's just where today, we're pretty green as we build out our integration and really standardized who we want to be and how do we manage our appetite guidelines rules, all that type of stuff.\n2355000, 2361000, We're just now in the process of kind of trying to set that up so makes sense and.\n2361000, 2372000, And one thing that we also observe is that, you know, you talked to you mentioned that you talked to each underwriter and they'll give you somewhat of a different answer in a different perspective.\n2372000, 2386000, Underwriter is or, you know, when constrained they'll oftentimes look at kind of just a set or sampling of the states in which a business operates or subset of some sort of employees to kind of you know spot check.\n2386000, 2397000, But often, you know, if you have the ability to actually know, we know the technology capability look at all of them, then you can surface things as the underwriter just like wouldn't pick up on.\n2397000, 2415000, And so that that's another thing that we see if you have a, you know, a property exposure reliability exposure and the underwriters only looking at the kind of three largest payroll locations or the two highest QV locate the ID locations.\n2415000, 2422000, They're spot chatting checking but but actually what they should be doing if they have the abilities is looking at the whole exposure.\n2422000, 2425000, Yeah, something that they were able to help you.\n2425000, 2436000, I wonder in particular on the kind of non comp book that you guys are looking to grow is that probably like a $1520 million book right now.\n2436000, 2443000, Good question. I mean, it's probably more sizable that I guess it's probably about $100 million.\n2443000, 2451000, And it's. So I might have been a little short change that it's by, you know, somewhere around 10 to 15% of our portfolio.\n2451000, 2463000, Alaska, Alaska National, obviously the company so we have a high market share there in the state of Alaska, and then in the PNW, mostly Washington.\n2463000, 2480000, Obviously, Washington doesn't have workers conference monolithic state and so we write a fair amount of other lines there as well. A lot of it's big hairy stuff right I mean it's it's, you know, like I said earlier, logistics firm that, you know, is\n2480000, 2502000, a couple hundred vehicle fleet trucking operation right a lot of like, we in Alaska we write a lot of tough stuff like marine operations and, you know, just stuff stuff that, you know, it because it's hairier we're spending a lot of time\n2502000, 2518000, putting boots on the ground and actually put eyes on the risk right there. The average premium up there is probably, you know, north of Washington is north of 100,000 where it makes sense to deploy resources like that and then in Alaska.\n2518000, 2527000, You know it's smaller policies but we tend to lost control a lot of risks up there.\n2527000, 2532000, So, it's perfect sense.\n2532000, 2543000, This has been very helpful hopefully this gave you a high level overview I realized that somewhat you know this an abstract discussion hard to perhaps visualize.\n2543000, 2552000, I guess I look to you what would be most helpful in terms of next step as it relates to kind of the things that you're prioritizing and executing against.\n2552000, 2567000, So, you guys taking the time I mean Alan spoke highly of you guys I'm a big Alan fan of known him for a long time and obviously wanted to at least get to know one another for future discussion it is something that's on my mind, right.\n2567000, 2584000, It doesn't make sense to me that we are, you know, aren't able to do a lot of year over year analysis on our submissions because our documentation is on an Excel spreadsheet that sits on someone's desktop I mean there's just a lot of standardization and data\n2584000, 2601000, that can take place with utilizing a tool like yours.\n2601000, 2619000, So, there's probably less value there versus the other lines, etc. And so it's definitely something that's on my mind and I appreciate the introduction and I would just ask, you know, let's stay connected and see how time progresses but I do feel like I need to get some of my, my basic\n2619000, 2633000, ducks in a row before I can really lay out the roadmap of, you know, hey, here's the gap. And let's figure out who can help build a gap. And at that point, it would be probably more appropriate discussion right.\n2633000, 2640000, Yeah, that's totally fair seems like you have some kind of basic meat and potatoes you want to solve.\n2640000, 2651000, And I think in terms of, you know, guide wire word of caution we've had you know all of our clients use either guide wire or duck creek or some other system.\n2651000, 2677000, And we've promised them you know underwriting workbench and underwriting insights and cognitive analytics and all these fancy names. And what ends up happening is that like it takes four to five years to implement and it, it doesn't solve the underwriters problem and it doesn't actually help them make better\n2677000, 2693000, policies but very different offering than we have. So, what I would say is, you know, when, when you deem it to be relevant and helpful. What we can do is actually walk through a demo together of co pilot and usually what we find helpful our clients find helpful is actually\n2693000, 2722000, taking in a handful of submissions that are currently kind of being worked on by your underwriters new business or renewals will kind of run them through copilot is walk through life together that oftentimes helps to bring into life in terms of like okay wow, you know, I would not have, you know, understood that prior to writing this, I would either have to cancel the policy or completely kind of change the premium and the client might cancel, or I risk you know, you know, incurring a loss that that would you know make this unprofitable for the next 100 years.\n2722000, 2747000, So, would you say that. Yeah, just just so I get clear yeah that's one last piece I'm sorry that I have to jump I have a lot of 15 but, of course, so would you say that the workflow, you know, do you guys have some of that in there so like queue management ability to send a task between users, you know, kind of date stamp timestamping those transactions as they change hands etc so all that live in there as well.\n2747000, 2752000, It does. We have. Yeah, okay. That's helpful.\n2752000, 2767000, I appreciate it Danny I'd say let's let's reconnect here in a couple months just do a quick check in, because I do think things are going to move and I want to, I want to start, you know, as we strategically think through pricing tools and how we're, you know, visualizing those bringing up together I do think,\n2767000, 2785000, you know, having a place is important to tie a lot of this stuff together, right, and I am trying to think through different options and solutions that can help do that in the most, you know, cost effective way with with ease of maintenance in mind right and all that good stuff and so I really appreciate the conversation\n2785000, 2796000, today. Of course yeah I mean our core value proposition is better risk selection and more profitable underwriting and certainly anything that comes along with that in terms of supporting underwriters, helping manage the flow.\n2796000, 2805000, We're all for it so thank you again Mark. Great to speak with you. You too. See you guys. Take care.

Good afternoon.\n117000, 119000, Hey Danny.\n119000, 120000, How are you?\n120000, 122000, Well, how are you today, Mark?\n122000, 123000, Good. Yeah.\n123000, 125000, So, you're in Phoenix?\n125000, 126000, Yeah.\n126000, 127000, Yep.\n127000, 128000, Since March.\n128000, 131000, So prior to that, I was in California.\n131000, 132000, Prior.\n132000, 135000, I've been, I've been in quite a few states, but yeah.\n135000, 137000, So right now family and I live in Phoenix.\n137000, 138000, So.\n138000, 139000, Nice.\n139000, 141000, For everyone.\n141000, 142000, Good. Yeah.\n142000, 146000, We were, we were in Northern LA.\n146000, 150000, And that's called thousand Oaks.\n150000, 154000, And we were able to secure a home out here, which was nice.\n154000, 156000, And so everything's been good.\n156000, 158000, Just, you know, we're used to moving.\n158000, 168000, So we've moved from Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Texas, twice, California, twice, Arizona, New Jersey, O'Boken.\n168000, 171000, We've been quite a few states.\n171000, 175000, So we're, we're fairly familiar with the strategy on how to move efficiently.\n175000, 176000, So.\n176000, 177000, Nice.\n177000, 182000, And that's on that latest move. And I feel like that, that experience is certainly eyeopening for the family.\n182000, 187000, Hopefully the kids get to meet new people and kind of experience.\n187000, 188000, Yeah.\n188000, 195000, Now the game plan was always to move and they grew as long as we could.\n195000, 202000, And then once the kids started to get to a point where, you know, school and friends became more material, we tried to slow it down.\n202000, 206000, But they're four right now. So they got twin boys. They just started preschool.\n206000, 212000, So we still got, we can potentially do a few more moves if we need to.\n212000, 215000, Well, Phoenix is a great area. So hopefully it's cooling down now.\n215000, 219000, And yeah, it is. It's great right now. Yeah. It's just starting to cool down.\n219000, 221000, So how about you guys? Where are you at?\n221000, 227000, We're both based in New York. So our offices are in Manhattan and I live in Brooklyn, Paul lives in Manhattan.\n227000, 230000, Okay, cool.\n230000, 236000, I was fortunate to spend a month with family out in Phoenix last summer.\n236000, 244000, And so I've always been kind of in and out for different like work trips. We never really got to spend time there. So I enjoyed it.\n244000, 249000, Yeah, so far so good. I mean, we've really enjoyed it.\n249000, 267000, The we got here out in March of this year. So we went through the summer. So now it is it is cooling down. I think today's a high of 82, which is amazing. So now it's getting to be weather where, you know, I can get back outside and start jogging again and doing some outdoor activities.\n267000, 277000, But I mean, it wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. But I did hear this was a lighter year for for the heat. So we'll we'll see how it looks next year.\n277000, 289000, Makes makes good sense. Well, thank you for taking the time to chat and I know some time in the works. Certainly, Alan Driscoll spoke highly of you and thought it'd be worthwhile for us to connect.\n289000, 298000, So learn a little bit more about you know, and copper coin and tell you a little bit more about our co pilot and see what would be most helpful.\n298000, 302000, Yeah, sounds like strategy where you guys want to start off.\n302000, 315000, Sure. So happy to give you kind of a high level overview of but it might be helpful also to understand a little bit more kind of work your priorities and yeah, customized kind of the discussion from there.\n315000, 332000, Yes, my background always have been in underwriting always PNC multi line underwriting not so much on the specialty or professional line side of the house more more traditional multi line package business.\n332000, 349000, So I was a copper point back in July of 19 was responsible for underwriting for the western region and then recently took a new role in April this year so a little bit about copper point so cover point.\n349000, 367000, The legacy state funds was privatized back in July or July I don't know what month it was but 2013 let's go with that. And really at that point, you know became less, no longer the state fund and really needed to stand on their own and start to develop\n367000, 369000, their strategy.\n369000, 373000, The CEO here is a gentleman named Mark Schmillen.\n373000, 386000, And he came to us from travelers he's been with the group for about five years. And, you know, really set the group on a journey to become a billion dollar plus carrier right and.\n386000, 403000, And so, the state fund, I don't know if you know a ton about how state funds operate but you know you're more or less the, the, the provider for all insurance needs to the state and it's less about underwriting or, or, or, you know, thinking through the profit\n403000, 413000, and loss it's more about just servicing and and and quoting without much underwriting judgment or or philosophy if you will so.\n413000, 418000, So, copper point was privatized.\n418000, 424000, 2015 we're 2016 we're probably around 300 million in premium.\n424000, 430000, That was, that was back in the day before workers comp rates have really declined.\n430000, 445000, And part of the big strategy was to grow through acquisitions and so in 2019, or, excuse me, end of 2017 they purchased a company called Pacific comp, which was a standalone work operator in the state of California.\n445000, 454000, With that obviously came roughly 170 million in premium came with them a distribution in the state of California.\n454000, 474000, And then shortly thereafter about a year later they acquired Alaska national, which was which was a pretty instrumental instrumental strategic purchase for us and Alaska national very service oriented organization but they they with a lot of workers\n474000, 485000, comp expertise but they also brought state expansion. So, copper point and Pacific comp were really kind of the southwest states if you will.\n485000, 500000, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Colorado, Utah, California, and then Alaska national brought 26 state filings and multi line PNC filings across all 26 states.\n500000, 518000, And so, you know, with that it really is allowing us to start position ourselves with who do we want to be in the future right so today we're 80% may maybe closer to 90% rate premium is standalone workers comp, and 10% comes from other lines other PNC lines,\n518000, 521000, and, you know, into the future.\n521000, 536000, I would like to see that probably closer to like a 2080. In the next few years, but it's going to take some time and so anyway so back to my role so three companies coming together three relatively smaller companies right Alaska nationals 250 million.\n536000, 552000, So the comp again around 170 and the copper point was like 250 300. And everyone managed things differently everyone, you know, the field managed a lot of their, you know, making filing decisions product decisions service decisions.\n552000, 570000, And so, through bringing three companies together, obviously a lot of integration efforts are taking place, and a need for a new role stood up and are introduced itself and so I took a role for on ready systems and product back in April and so my responsibility\n570000, 582000, was to serve as the enterprise voice for you know what technology what systems do we need to drive the strategy from our underwriting standpoint, which really is all policy if you will.\n582000, 593000, And then, and then also things like customer maintenance, so things like Salesforce those those would fall under my umbrella really the tools and technology.\n593000, 604000, So it's customer base, if you will. And then, so within that it's policy I got digital, I've got Salesforce, or tools like that.\n604000, 617000, And so right now we have multiple policy systems across the enterprise we have multiple supporting products across the enterprise and so we're looking to start to, you know, come up with a vision of what does that look like going forward.\n617000, 629000, So that's one piece and then the other is product, I'm responsible for so that's, you know, product research product development maintenance of products doing filings keeping up with circulars, etc.\n629000, 646000, So, yeah, so that's, that's my role and so it's been going since about April, and right now the journey is just really kind of getting the basics or the fundamentals in place so instead of three people managing circulars, you know, having one group manage\n646000, 659000, circulars and do it across all systems, instead of, you know, three ways of it taking or submitting tickets for, you know, backlog enhancements etc having one process.\n659000, 667000, And so we're just kind of building out our, who we are, how do we work type of a mentality.\n667000, 681000, And, and, and just to be clear my team is not responsible for it, we're not responsible for the actual maintenance development we're casting the vision and partnering with our partners to bring it to life right so.\n681000, 686000, That's a, that's a long overview but hopefully gave you guys good insights.\n686000, 700000, Yeah, certainly very helpful appreciate that that comprehensive overview and it seems like in many ways, you're taking three kind of legacy platforms three legacy operations are really unifying them so that carport one is better positioned for the future\n700000, 707000, and that spans kind of the whole gamut of different operational components and underwriting support etc.\n707000, 719000, Yeah, I mean it's it's it's happening across all our enterprise so it's operations, right, how do we standardize that it's standard standing up an EDW right i mean it's everyone's going through integration.\n719000, 733000, I'm responsible for the systems and, and as it relates to underwriting as well as the product side. So, makes a lot of sense and I would wonder as you kind of think about some of the key business metrics and KPIs that you guys are excellent against.\n733000, 751000, What are some of the key objectives in terms of underwriting kind of profitability and premium birth obviously mentioned the vision of getting to $1 billion in premium I guess you guys are probably three quarters or so the way there but wonder if they're also kind of objectives\n751000, 758000, around improving loss ratio and kind of combined ratio and how that fits into what you guys are tackling day to day.\n758000, 774000, Right, we try to establish KPIs right we try to establish any strategic direction that we go to what are we going to measure ourselves against right what did we define if we achieved it or not right so anything that we can measure we try to, you know,\n774000, 792000, we're going to take it to, you know, rate retention, hit ratios quote ratios flow metrics we've we've went through the process of kind of outlining an ideal state of portfolio KPIs needed to effectively manage the business with drill down capabilities, etc.\n792000, 797000, So that's more like a PNL owner level if you will.\n797000, 810000, We're just, you know, today, we intake business differently right where in Alaska National League, they track business on Excel spreadsheets they don't put it in a policy system so you can't do flow metrics right.\n810000, 829000, We've got an ideal state of what PNL owners are going to be responsible for and what they need actual implementation of that is going to take time just because our data is fairly fractured our our different differs by entity obviously and then, you know,\n829000, 843000, we always have specific goals whether it's rate retention, new business hit ratios, new business ratings renewal retention rounding out business growth and certain verticals right.\n843000, 847000, We try and establish a lot of those as well.\n847000, 862000, You know, and we kind of take the approach of manage the goals to the level we can write and so if they become something where yeah I can give you my, your team's overall rate objective will target that for the team we might not be able to isolate that to the\n862000, 864000, individual's desk right.\n864000, 866000, Like that.\n866000, 879000, That's certainly helpful and if I recall correctly the the last year of your premium is comp, you guys are continuing to expand additional product lines I guess part of the regional expansion as well.\n879000, 897000, Yeah, so, yes, we just went through a five year pro forma, where we're really, you know, talking about what's our organic growth strategy, non M&A, and what does that mean for, you know, bringing other lines to our to try and round out our workers\n897000, 909000, and our comms solutions what does it mean to our state footprint and where do we want to have, you know, boots on the ground versus a, just a digital presence.\n909000, 925000, And so, yep, we're going through all of that, you know, I would say for the foreseeable future, our focus is going to be on our kind of 10 Western states, which is Alaska, Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, those kind of states, if you will, that\n925000, 929000, will start to drift over towards the Midwest.\n929000, 940000, But you know, a big believer in again doing, doing the basics really well executing well on those and there's a lot of market share potential in the current states that we, we penetrate.\n940000, 946000, Yeah, expansion, expansion

and I started the company about three years ago, really with the objective of empowering underwriters to achieve superior outcomes and the way that we do that is primarily through a software as a

know, a big believer in again doing, doing the basics really well executing well on those and there's a lot of market share potential in the current states that we, we penetrate.\n940000, 946000, Yeah, expansion, expansion is on the horizon just a little ways out.\n946000, 955000, That makes perfect sense so that's that's very helpful context and to give you kind of a high level sense for Aleppo.\n955000, 968000, Paul and I started the company about three years ago, really with the objective of empowering underwriters to achieve superior outcomes and the way that we do that is primarily through a software as a service capability called co pilot, which\n968000, 984000, helps underwriters make underwriting decisions, and that breaks down into kind of a few sub components in terms of how we're helping them to select better risk how we're helping them to prioritize their time and focus on kind of the best opportunities but ultimately\n984000, 1000000, what we see is across, across carrier is underwriters are pulled into pretty opposing directions on the one hand they're kind of asked to be very fast and very efficient in terms of getting quotes out to brokers and maintaining those relationships, essentially\n1000000, 1012000, you know saying yes wherever possible to grow premium. On the other hand, they're actually being told hey, you guys are the last kind of guardians of the quality of the book, we need to make sure that we're being, you know, very thoughtful and following\n1012000, 1020000, our guidelines and being very thorough and selecting risk. And so they're constantly, you know, toggling back between the two of those.\n1020000, 1033000, That actually through through, you know, co pilot, we can help to reconcile those and actually help underwriters do better on both dimensions. And so that's really been the focus we've been deployed at handful of largest carriers in the US and\n1033000, 1047000, continuing to grow very rapidly. And basically, you know, our clients have their submission flow flow into our co pilot software, the software helps to triage and focus the time on where they'll be actually get the biggest bang for their buck.\n1047000, 1059000, And then ultimately give them the insights that they need to know, powered by AI powered by kind of data in order to really kind of make a smarter decision use their underwriting discretion in the most effective way.\n1059000, 1072000, Yeah, voting faster, putting the right business. It's a declination get that out quickly so you can both move on and good partner to the broker. So that's kind of the 40,000.\n1072000, 1083000, I think I'm actually I mean so interesting enough I was talking to a software provider that I think probably does similar to what you're you're mentioning.\n1083000, 1089000, I called it an underwriting workbench I don't think that they liked it.\n1089000, 1102000, Because I think, you know, the reality of the tools that you guys are bringing to the table are much more dynamic and much more, you know, capable than just an underwriting workbench or workstation right.\n1102000, 1109000, But, you know, what I, what I had articulated on that conversation was that,\n1109000, 1125000, they were talking about rules and, you know, hey, imagine being able to manage your, your property capacity much more sophisticated right. So if you wanted to say, hey, in this specific territory, I need more rate or you can't write more than X amount of premium, etc.\n1125000, 1141000, You could build that rule in that it would feature underwriter, etc. And as a, as they deal through, you know, submission flow that it would, it would systematically help prioritize you know where it sits in the, in the kind of hopper if you will based on the rules, etc.\n1141000, 1170000, And, you know, where my needs are today, you know, the tools that folks like, you know, you're mine, I'm kind of just speaking in general terms I hope you don't take this to you guys specifically because, like you said, you only gave me the 40,000 foot level, you know, where you guys, where I struggle today is at the very, very basics of insurance 101 right so you talked about appetite, you know, we don't have a, a, a enterprise.\n1170000, 1183000, Enterprise wide appetite today, I mean we do but it's very generic it's, you know, red, yellow, green by by workers comp class code it's not, you know, if this is an excavator.\n1183000, 1198000, These are the types of things that you should look for you shouldn't look for or maybe minimum premiums associated with it or or guidelines or rules specifically around territories or deployment of property capacity or cat modeling, etc.\n1198000, 1201000, We're very rudimentary.\n1201000, 1204000, At this point and kind of that infrastructure.\n1204000, 1222000, And so I'm in the process of trying to build all that but it's going to be, it's going to be a journey and, you know, right now we're just trying to do the crosswalk between, you know, nakes code versus sick code versus ISO CGL versus WC IRB versus NCCI so that we can have a better way of managing appetite.\n1222000, 1230000, Designing a system that actually can adjust that and rules around that etc. Right now we're just starting to think through that.\n1230000, 1247000, But where we break down today is really more like in, in the basics of just workflow, right, and, you know, one of the the platforms that we have is guide where guide where as a policy system does things really good but what it doesn't do great is is, you know, workflow,\n1247000, 1256000, and, you know, being able to kind of manage monitor the handoffs from, you know, hey, this was submitted to me.\n1256000, 1266000, Now I went out got additional information now I passed it back to my underwriter my underwriter now has been there to, you know, they release a quote.\n1266000, 1276000, Now it actually shows status it says it's been released etc right and so they the workflow is a big gap that we're feeling right now.\n1276000, 1297000, And so, you know, as well as just being on multiple policy systems right and so guide wire is is in a lot of ways, what we're building towards for the future for workers comp we're still exploring the PNC lines and what makes best sense there for our policy system but anyway so yeah I think I've ever heard of a company called Federado.\n1297000, 1306000, Right.\n1306000, 1315000, That's the, that's the company I was mentioning there earlier but is that a general kind of overview of the tool like would you call it an underwriting workstation or how would you describe it I guess.\n1315000, 1333000, I mean I understand that you were characterized in an underwriter workbench or workstation around kind of rules and you know sorting and the like. That's probably a very small component of what co pilot does and co pilot is really moving beyond those those static roles.\n1333000, 1349000, You know when you manage the business and too much of a rigid way there are kind of too many exceptions too many things that don't fit. And therefore it all just piles up on the underwriters kind of lap. And I guess I'd wonder, you know, what is the overall submission flow that you guys are seeing\n1349000, 1357000, right now is there a certain volume that you're kind of receiving in terms of inbound submissions and how do you anticipate that background.\n1357000, 1366000, Yeah, we probably I mean enterprise wide we probably get somewhere around 20,000 submissions a year in the state of California alone we probably get 15,000.\n1366000, 1372000, And I would anticipate that only to go upward, you know, based on our partnerships.\n1372000, 1389000, We are, we do business with limited and preferred distribution channels so we're not out talking to every single brokerage and retailer we select who we want to partner with and it's based on having a sizeable mature partnership and relationship and so.\n1389000, 1402000, You know as our strategy changes as our, as our product offering grows etc in the future we would anticipate you know more and more submission flow to come. Now that being said, you know the marketplace has changed a lot.\n1402000, 1420000, And because of efficiencies and, you know, upload capabilities and OCR functionality I mean, you know, most broker partners, block the market right I mean you get a lot of submissions just because they don't want someone else to come in and snipe, snipe them\n1420000, 1432000, and, you know, try and chase them down that that that had a just a block that it wouldn't have been this right so not every submission we receive is a viable opportunity for sure.\n1432000, 1438000, And how many underwriters you have to work through that, that overall flow.\n1438000, 1443000, Good question so we probably got.\n1443000, 1450000, So we probably have about 55 underwriters.\n1450000, 1455000, Probably a mix of underwriters and assistant underwriters and kind of like.\n1455000, 1477000, I think that's probably mostly just underwriters, you know, we're very hands on service based organization and so, but also we're still dealing on Excel spreadsheets right so it's a fairly manual process today and so we do have, you know, a fairly\n1477000, 1493000, I mean, you know, with the manual load we have to staff obviously according to support that and so we have, I would guess we have probably like a two to one ratio right now, every two underwriters one AU.\n1493000, 1504000, And then with workers, I mean I'm sure you know this, you know, workers copy don't really need like a reader or someone in processing I mean it's a pretty standard.\n1504000, 1515000, Yeah, I mean it's pretty straightforward, and you know so we do have some readers, obviously that support the PNC lines where it's much more complicated submission and take and and quote process.\n1515000, 1522000, But for workers comp, usually the use or the agent just upload to the our portal.\n1522000, 1536000, Makes perfect sense and one thing that we commonly see is that organizations are just, you know, constrained as many underwriters as they have there's always just a ton of work to get done and so either you're kind of getting through the volume, but you're\n1536000, 1546000, cutting corners and underwriters are just not being as thorough and they may make you know, make pretty large mistakes which can be very costly in terms of dissipated losses.\n1546000, 1555000, On the other hand, they can kind of go into the nitty gritty and and they may just take way too long to quote and then miss opportunities and that's that's all kind of missed opportunity.\n1555000, 1571000, So the question is, how can you actually get the most out of your underwriting staff and ultimately what we see is that underwriters end up either, you know, wasting time on submissions that that never end up coding or that quote and have very low likelihood of\n1571000, 1573000, binding.\n1573000, 1588000, It doesn't fit in the box that we're looking for, or the burpers are spraying and praying and kind of wasting our time if we've seen this risk for the last four years and you know we always quote and never binds and probably don't want to waste time on it\n1588000, 1589000, this year.\n1589000, 1604000, And so really helping underwriters first of all understand kind of which opportunities are actually good ones. That's something that we can do in kind of an automated scalable way using that AI, and then with underwriter feedback observing their behavior that\n1604000, 1618000, consistently improves. And then really importantly when an underwriter is actually looking at a given risk, one thing that we see is that, you know, even if they're not working with with spreadsheets per se there's still a ton of manual work that they need to do.\n1618000, 1632000, They need to kind of go online to check you know what is the, you know, loss history and you look at news articles they might look at the business and see their customer reviews or their employee reviews, and all of that in order to kind of get the necessary data points\n1632000, 1637000, in order to develop a perspective and make a decision.\n1637000, 1652000, And so the perspective is that actually a lot of that is stuff that we can collect and make inferences on and actually present the underwriter with this is what you need to know about this risk. Let's say this is a contractor they you know they say that they don't do roofing\n1652000, 1653000, work.\n1653000, 1666000, They say they do roofing they're going to get charged more broker advised and that such, but actually, you know, software went through 300 customer reviews about this business and actually finds that seven people said, Oh, this contractor did a great job installing\n1666000, 1680000, solar panels on my roof well clearly do some roofing work and maybe there are another 20 permits for roofing you know installation in the county like Department of Buildings. Hey underwriter like this doesn't quite add up.\n1680000, 1683000, You should, you know, follow up on this. Yeah.\n1683000, 1695000, So, there won't be a scenario where you see a claim come in you know with an employee falling off the roof. If you're actually doing that proper dating upfront and understanding exactly.\n1695000, 1705000, Yeah, no, it makes a lot of sense. So, I mean, I guess just high level, you know who all plays in your tool right so is it specifically an underwriter tool only.\n1705000, 1718000, And then, you know, kind of where do you see an underwriter start with your with the deployments that you've done so far, you know, where do you see an underwriter start engaging your tool versus stop engaging your tool right so within a submission lifecycle\n1718000, 1720000, experience.\n1720000, 1735000, Well, all good questions. So generally it's underwriters and some support staff that are using the software management have different dashboards to kind of oversee, you know, operation and kind of make sure that everything's going well but by and large underwriters\n1735000, 1752000, or the users. Typically, there is a submission flow coming in, and that will either go through, you know, clearing and be assigned to underwriters or that will come you know directly from the email inbox or portal into co pilot and then be assigned to\n1752000, 1754000, underwriters.\n1754000, 1766000, So, generally, kind of that initial triage assessment evaluation phase is all done in co pilot varies by client in terms of how specifically rating is done.\n1766000, 1777000, Some clients have kind of dedicated models or spreadsheets or report over they kind of punch in numbers and that generates the rate.", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 1, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "44c83839-e8af-46b4-998f-e60040e56c6d", "node_info": {"start": 13562, "end": 28192}}, "7326667864837873280": {"text": "using the software management have different dashboards to kind of oversee, you know, operation and kind of make sure that everything's going well but by and large underwriters\n1735000, 1752000, or the users.

Increasingly some clients are looking to move their reading into co pilot.\n1777000, 1788000, And then back it's the point where you're actually issuing a quote, we don't do any of the paper generation we don't do any of the actual kind of billing and policy.\n1788000, 1798000, It's really around that upfront underwriting process. And certainly for kind of monitoring the accounts for renewals. That's all done co pilot as well.\n1798000, 1802000, Okay, so, so\n1802000, 1808000, correspondence correspondence.\n1808000, 1811000, All of that yeah saving documents with that.\n1811000, 1817000, Correct, and referrals and collaboration around specific accounts.\n1817000, 1832000, Is that we've increasingly kind of supporting initially co pilot was more focused on actual risk selection and understanding the risk itself but especially during coven a lot of clients that hey, you know, our teams are remote.\n1832000, 1844000, We want them to be able to collaborate, you know more effective around accounts and so there are different enhancements that we've built in in order to facilitate that workflow component of it to just make everyone's lives easier and get to\n1844000, 1861000, the bottom of it. Yeah, I think that I think this is off topic here but I do think that, you know, technologies more advanced than the carriers are these days you know, generally speaking, I think carriers just in general are still trying to get the basics\n1861000, 1864000, of it. That's where a lot of opportunity resides.\n1864000, 1881000, But it's it's it's funny and so they take a really slick tool like what you probably guys have here or have built here and then they, they dummy it down if you will to fill up fills the needs of some really rudimentary things that we just have struggled with as a, as a, as an industry\n1881000, 1891000, at the time right which is a, which is a good thing but it's because it makes your tool or comprehensive but it's it's always interesting because that's the same challenge we face right so.\n1891000, 1906000, So, cool. I can imagine for sure I mean carriers realistically have so many things that they're kind of blocking and tackling and managing and developing kind of world class software is not a core.\n1906000, 1918000, They're also you know managing kind of multiple integrations and legacy systems and so it's really hard to get the cutting edge when you're just trying to catch up and kind of get things to keep the lights on.\n1918000, 1927000, We come in companies like us in order to basically you know partner and support that.\n1927000, 1937000, So we started a very pragmatic way, so our clients will use the copilot software out of the box about any need for integration we can plug in this submission inbox and kind of a start using copilot.\n1937000, 1951000, Gradually our clients I hate you know actually it'd be helpful to view our, our kind of book, you know losses and copilot would be helpful if we can actually add these additional modeling components to copilot and so as we deepen our relationship with\n1951000, 1964000, clients and we support additional kind of integrations and really help them manage some of their internal data as well. Sure. Yeah, makes sense. What are. So you were asking about rules earlier so are those used to help the AI.\n1964000, 1972000, And where you guys do anything with appetite or or or guidelines specifically or not so much.\n1972000, 1987000, Yeah, I mean it's it's really helping you know our focus is on helping our clients insurers make sure that they are writing the right risks. And so, that starts off with, you know, what do they want to write versus what they're actually writing right now and helping to\n1987000, 1999000, you know, bridge that gap. So, when we start off we'll say hey, why don't you send us your renewal book for the next month or the next quarter. Let's run it through copilot and actually see what copilot tells us.\n1999000, 2009000, And oftentimes there are 25% of the risks that are just completely out of appetite, it should have never been written, you want to get off of them as soon as possible.\n2009000, 2022000, Another 10 15% that actually probably require some, you know, premium adjustments or some kind of endorsements exclusions. And so without actually, you know, changing fundamentally how they think about risk.\n2022000, 2033000, It's just like let's cross the keys and dot the eyes on things that you already want to be doing and you're not currently doing because underwriters are just stretched.\n2033000, 2043000, Even if you had, you know, large battery of underwriters with a lot of time, they wouldn't necessarily be able to kind of uncover all the insights that we're bringing forth through that.\n2043000, 2055000, So, that's kind of one component of just like, let's actually make sure that you are focusing on opportunities that you want your directors to focus on and writing the risk that you want.\n2055000, 2072000, Yeah, it makes sense. I mean, the reality is every talk to 100 underwriters every writer will have a different way of how they underwrite. Right. So, when you standardize it and have a system help guide it right I mean it's it's much easier to say, or get some consistency\n2072000, 2088000, in the interpretation of underwriting because it is great. Right. So, but it sounds like when you do that renewal ingestion or kind of batch process, you're doing that based on some sort of rules or guidelines that the carrier your partner would would provide you that\n2088000, 2106000, you use to map against the risk serve. Yeah, and it varies in terms of level of sophistication so we're meeting clients kind of where they are there are some clients that we, you know, like hospitality and we like restaurants but we don't like, you know,\n2106000, 2119000, childcare and we don't like education, and they're getting submissions across the whole spectrum, and it may be an underwriter five minutes to realize like, I have no business looking at this because I can't even write it, you don't want it.\n2119000, 2136000, So, that's the highest level of kind of aggregation, going down into different class codes that you know are acceptable or not acceptable and that may vary by state going down into, okay, you know we do like, you know, landscapers will we don't want landscapers who chopped\n2136000, 2139000, down trees. That's a very different you know exposure.\n2139000, 2151000, So, the more nuanced that is there the more nuanced we're able to kind of embed in co pilot. Yep, make sure that the right underwriters are spending their time on what's actually available.\n2151000, 2154000, That makes sense.\n2154000, 2172000, And so, as you kind of think about some of the, you know, the near term objectives that your underwriters are kind of executing against or their specific things that are kind of being emphasized to them in terms of, hey, you know, we are trying to improve our risk\n2172000, 2188000, collection and these classes, or trying to make sure that we at least have a first glimpse at all risks versus you know we've seen many cases where they're just, you know, some submissions that never get touched because there isn't bandwidth for that and\n2188000, 2196000, therefore that you know, perhaps is missed opportunity for risks that could have been worthwhile.\n2196000, 2210000, I would, I would say yeah I mean that's most certainly a need for that today. We probably don't know what we don't know right just because of our data living in three different systems and some of our data not even making the system.\n2210000, 2222000, I don't have a clear line of sight into, you know, we prep everything so we have underwriting coordinators that are like a reader or processor.\n2222000, 2227000, It's funny Jen popped up in my, my elbow there.\n2227000, 2241000, And they prep so we have, you know, they go out, pull the website they pull E-mod information that they prep a lot of files but that, you know, how many of those files made it to the underwriter and the underwriter never actually had capacity to vet out that\n2241000, 2252000, one opportunity versus they did and they just passed on it. You know, we don't have a robust enough platform today.\n2252000, 2259000, Pulling all that so we should take experience together to really analyze the data to the level you're speaking of.\n2259000, 2275000, And, you know, ideally, right, as we, as we build out our guide where it works come solution.\n2275000, 2293000, And leveraging, you know, pricing model where where appropriate and so some things, you know, we're going to design rules that say hey if it's this class code if it's the mods less than this right, you know, the very basic stuff.\n2293000, 2321000, We'll not even give it to an underwriter right but then once it gets to an underwriter, how competent am I in that they're, that they're looking at them all not very confident how confident am I in that they are looking at them in a similar lens, not very confident right I mean if you, if you, Alaska National, the company that we purchased their, their, their model was hey submit everything to us we'll underwrite it right they didn't have appetite so they have guidelines.\n2321000, 2333000, That's all foreign to that that underwriting team and so it was more around how can we, how can we crack the code where other carriers can't write every other carriers declining your logistics business.\n2333000, 2343000, Well, let me let me look at that and pick the cherry out of the out of the group and partner with Yana and write that and be profitable together and so.\n2343000, 2355000, Again, that's just where today, we're pretty green as we build out our integration and really standardized who we want to be and how do we manage our appetite guidelines rules, all that type of stuff.\n2355000, 2361000, We're just now in the process of kind of trying to set that up so makes sense and.\n2361000, 2372000, And one thing that we also observe is that, you know, you talked to you mentioned that you talked to each underwriter and they'll give you somewhat of a different answer in a different perspective.\n2372000, 2386000, Underwriter is or, you know, when constrained they'll oftentimes look at kind of just a set or sampling of the states in which a business operates or subset of some sort of employees to kind of you know spot check.\n2386000, 2397000, But often, you know, if you have the ability to actually know, we know the technology capability look at all of them, then you can surface things as the underwriter just like wouldn't pick up on.\n2397000, 2415000, And so that that's another thing that we see if you have a, you know, a property exposure reliability exposure and the underwriters only looking at the kind of three largest payroll locations or the two highest QV locate the ID locations.\n2415000, 2422000, They're spot chatting checking but but actually what they should be doing if they have the abilities is looking at the whole exposure.\n2422000, 2425000, Yeah, something that they were able to help you.\n2425000, 2436000, I wonder in particular on the kind of non comp book that you guys are looking to grow is that probably like a $1520 million book right now.\n2436000, 2443000, Good question. I mean, it's probably more sizable that I guess it's probably about $100 million.\n2443000, 2451000, And it's. So I might have been a little short change that it's by, you know, somewhere around 10 to 15% of our portfolio.\n2451000, 2463000, Alaska, Alaska National, obviously the company so we have a high market share there in the state of Alaska, and then in the PNW, mostly Washington.\n2463000, 2480000, Obviously, Washington doesn't have workers conference monolithic state and so we write a fair amount of other lines there as well. A lot of it's big hairy stuff right I mean it's it's, you know, like I said earlier, logistics firm that, you know, is\n2480000, 2502000, a couple hundred vehicle fleet trucking operation right a lot of like, we in Alaska we write a lot of tough stuff like marine operations and, you know, just stuff stuff that, you know, it because it's hairier we're spending a lot of time\n2502000, 2518000, putting boots on the ground and actually put eyes on the risk right there. The average premium up there is probably, you know, north of Washington is north of 100,000 where it makes sense to deploy resources like that and then in Alaska.\n2518000, 2527000, You know it's smaller policies but we tend to lost control a lot of risks up there.\n2527000, 2532000, So, it's perfect sense.\n2532000, 2543000, This has been very helpful hopefully this gave you a high level overview I realized that somewhat you know this an abstract discussion hard to perhaps visualize.\n2543000, 2552000, I guess I look to you what would be most helpful in terms of next step as it relates to kind of the things that you're prioritizing and executing against.\n2552000, 2567000, So, you guys taking the time I mean Alan spoke highly of you guys I'm a big Alan fan of known him for a long time and obviously wanted to at least get to know one another for future discussion it is something that's on my mind, right.\n2567000, 2584000, It doesn't make sense to me that we are, you know, aren't able to do a lot of year over year analysis on our submissions because our documentation is on an Excel spreadsheet that sits on someone's desktop I mean there's just a lot of standardization and data\n2584000, 2601000, that can take place with utilizing a tool like yours.\n2601000, 2619000, So, there's probably less value there versus the other lines, etc. And so it's definitely something that's on my mind and I appreciate the introduction and I would just ask, you know, let's stay connected and see how time progresses but I do feel like", "doc_id": null, "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "index": 2, "child_indices": [], "ref_doc_id": "44c83839-e8af-46b4-998f-e60040e56c6d", "node_info": {"start": 28169, "end": 42763}}, "8106460922068977197": {"text": "a big Alan fan of known him for a long time and obviously wanted to at least get to know one another for future discussion it is something that's on my mind, right.\n2567000, 2584000, It doesn't make sense to me that we are, you know, aren't able to do a lot of year over year analysis on our submissions because our documentation is on an Excel spreadsheet that sits on someone's desktop I mean there's just a lot of standardization and data\n2584000, 2601000, that can take place with utilizing a tool like yours.\n2601000, 2619000, So, there's probably less value there versus the other lines, etc. And so it's definitely something that's on my mind and I appreciate the introduction and I would just ask, you know, let's stay connected and see how time progresses but I do feel like I need to get some of my, my basic\n2619000, 2633000, ducks in a row before I can really lay out the roadmap of, you know, hey, here's the gap. And let's figure out who can help build a gap. And at that point, it would be probably more appropriate discussion right.\n2633000, 2640000, Yeah, that's totally fair seems like you have some kind of basic meat and potatoes you want to solve.\n2640000, 2651000, And I think in terms of, you know, guide wire word of caution we've had you know all of our clients use either guide wire or duck creek or some other system.\n2651000, 2677000, And we've promised them you know underwriting workbench and underwriting insights and cognitive analytics and all these fancy names. And what ends up happening is that like it takes four to five years to implement and it, it doesn't solve the underwriters problem and it doesn't actually help them make better\n2677000, 2693000, policies but very different offering than we have. So, what I would say is, you know, when, when you deem it to be relevant and helpful. What we can do is actually walk through a demo together of co pilot and usually what we find helpful our clients find helpful is actually\n2693000, 2722000, taking in a handful of submissions that are currently kind of being worked on by your underwriters new business or renewals will kind of run them through copilot is walk through life together that oftentimes helps to bring into life in terms of like okay wow, you know, I would not have, you know, understood that prior to writing this, I would either have to cancel the policy or completely kind of change the premium and the client might cancel, or I risk you know, you know, incurring a loss that that would you know make this unprofitable for the next 100 years.\n2722000, 2747000, So, would you say that. Yeah, just just so I get clear yeah that's one last piece I'm sorry that I have to jump I have a lot of 15 but, of course, so would you say that the workflow, you know, do you guys have some of that in there so like queue management ability to send a task between users, you know, kind of date stamp timestamping those transactions as they change hands etc so all that live in there as well.\n2747000, 2752000, It does. We have. Yeah, okay. That's helpful.\n2752000, 2767000, I appreciate it Danny I'd say let's let's reconnect here in a couple months just do a quick check in, because I do think things are going to move and I want to, I want to start, you know, as we strategically think through pricing tools and how we're, you know, visualizing those bringing up together I do think,\n2767000, 2785000, you know, having a place is important to tie a lot of this stuff together, right, and I am trying to think through different options and solutions that can help do that in the most, you know, cost effective way with with ease of maintenance in mind right and all that good stuff and so I really appreciate the conversation\n2785000, 2796000, today. Of course yeah I mean our core value proposition is better risk selection and more profitable underwriting and certainly anything that comes along with that in terms of supporting underwriters, helping manage the flow.\n2796000, 2805000, We're all for it so thank you again Mark. Great to speak with you. You too. See you guys. Take care.
