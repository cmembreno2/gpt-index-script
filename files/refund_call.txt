0, 4000, MUSIC
7000, 8000, Excuse me?
8000, 10000, Oh, hi there. How can I help you?
10000, 12000, I bought this jacket yesterday and I'd like a refund.
12000, 14000, Oh, okay. What was wrong with it?
14000, 17000, Well, when I bought it, it had a massive rip in it.
17000, 21000, Oh, I'm sorry about that. Do you have your receipt?
21000, 23000, Well, that's the thing. When I bought it, I wasn't given a receipt.
23000, 25000, Oh, that's strange.
25000, 28000, We should be giving you a receipt when you make a purchase here.
28000, 32000, In any case, our refund policy actually states that you need a receipt.
32000, 35000, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, I've got a jacket with a rip in it
35000, 38000, and I wasn't given a receipt, so...
38000, 42000, All right. Well, let me just speak to my manager
42000, 44000, and I'll see what I can do for you.
44000, 45000, Sure.
45000, 48000, Oh, but before I do that, are you able to show me your bank transaction details
48000, 51000, which prove you bought the jacket at our store?
51000, 53000, Yeah, just give me a second.
53000, 57000, There you go.
59000, 62000, Okay, thank you. I'll be one moment.
68000, 69000, How'd you go?
69000, 72000, Okay, so I've spoken to my manager and I've got good news.
72000, 76000, First of all, we're so sorry about the rip that shouldn't have happened to you at all.
76000, 78000, Yeah, that was kind of annoying.
78000, 82000, But we can definitely refund you since you could show us your bank transaction details.
82000, 83000, Perfect.
83000, 85000, All right, so how do you like me to process this one?
85000, 88000, We can do cash, store credit, or we can just swap it for a new one.
88000, 91000, I think I just want my money back, so a refund, please.
91000, 92000, Okay.
92000, 95000, I'll get you to fill out this refund form.
95000, 97000, And we'll go from there.
97000, 98000, Sure.
98000, 118000, Thanks very much.
