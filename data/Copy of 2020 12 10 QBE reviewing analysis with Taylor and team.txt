0, 11760, What you guys through kind of we've updated the docs here, added a few things and actually
11760, 15440, have gone deeper on a lot of materials around guidelines that Jason shared.
15440, 17360, Thank you for checking those Jason.
17360, 21360, I wanted to talk through those because they tie nicely into a lot of features that we're
21360, 25560, developing a number of things that we can add really off the bat and we had a bunch
25560, 29960, of questions for you guys on that front.
29960, 34240, The thunder there, I just kind of give you a preview is implementing the guidelines that
34240, 39360, you guys have in Copilot is actually quite straightforward already.
39360, 43520, It will be even more straightforward in a couple of weeks because there's going to be
43520, 48320, an ability for you guys to actually edit guidelines and appetite directly and that push through
48320, 50600, to all the underwriters.
50600, 54160, One important thing there is that we have noticed and wanted to confirm with you guys
54160, 57640, as we started looking at the renewals, we wanted to make sure that we were understanding
57640, 62720, all the details of those guidelines correctly, but there seem to be some areas where unsurprisingly,
62720, 68560, if you have a submission of 300 locations, checking each individual one of them to see
68560, 73800, what county it's in and then checking to see kind of each of these reports might not happen
73800, 78880, consistently and I think that's one area where I mean Copilot doesn't care if it's one location,
78880, 83000, two locations, 500 locations, it can check everything consistently, accurately every
83000, 84000, time.
84000, 85000, Yeah, that's a good point.
85000, 86000, Good.
86000, 90880, And just before I forget, so I did talk to Dan last week or end of last week.
90880, 91880, We're trying to find a tie.
91880, 98680, He had a couple of conflict days, but we're trying to get somebody probably either late,
98680, 102440, probably in the next week or the very beginning of the following week.
102440, 105480, That's kind of what we're getting at, but we should hopefully we'll get that locked
105480, 109560, down to just try to get the full team there.
109560, 111360, That sounds great and we're very flexible.
111360, 112920, So let us know what works in your end.
112920, 115360, Yeah, just want to make sure.
115360, 121880, Seems like most people are actually working the week before Christmas or not like usual
121880, 124400, where that whole two week block seems to be.
124400, 129360, We're all done on Christmas week, not going to happen.
129360, 134400, I guess the notion of weekends, weekdays, holidays, it's kind of all melded together
134400, 135400, this year.
135400, 136400, Yeah, they all feel the same.
136400, 137400, It's kind of good.
137400, 144760, You know, it used to be you get to Sunday night and be like that tomorrow, you know,
144760, 145760, got to do it right now.
145760, 146760, It doesn't really matter.
146760, 149760, You know, on Mondays they're more variable.
149760, 156480, We were talking this morning and actually a prospective investor was reaching out and
156480, 160560, we're talking to her this morning and she asked like, they said, well, we just wrote
160560, 163880, some white blanket kind of thing behind her.
163880, 168240, Well, we're supposed to be doing like a professional thing and they didn't look good in my background
168240, 172520, and I have like a nine month old baby and my husband had to take care of my.
172520, 175520, Yeah, that's how it works these days.
175520, 176520, Wonderful.
176520, 181280, So let me go ahead and share my screen and I think it will look quite familiar to what
181280, 183680, you've seen before, but I wanted to highlight a couple of things.
183680, 186440, Let me know when you're able to see.
186440, 190320, Yep, we can see.
190320, 194160, So this is unchanged from what you guys have.
194160, 195680, This is unchanged.
195680, 197040, So you have seen all this.
197040, 201880, So the numbers, so we updated, this is updated up to December 6.
201880, 204880, So three days ago, we did as of three days ago.
204880, 207880, Interestingly, you know, I mean, the numbers change a little bit.
207880, 212240, One thing that we noticed is it might just be the time of the year, but you know, before
212240, 216720, we had a snapshot in October and now we have kind of October, all in November, few days
216720, 224080, in December, the duration, the time that a quote spends in, not a quote, that a risk
224080, 227200, spends in that submission stage.
227200, 228840, Before we had nine days on average.
228840, 230760, Now the average is about 13.
230760, 234640, And we're looking at that before it was, it went from nine to four and a half or a little
234640, 235640, bit under four and a half.
235640, 240000, It was about 54% with more data.
240000, 244280, It's actually a 44% decline, but from a larger base from 13 days to over 7.3.
244280, 245960, That's kind of the top down.
245960, 248280, It's just looking at that stage.
248280, 251960, Time spans basically, you know, from the time it shifted to submission to the time
251960, 257160, it shifted from submission to something else, which is generally quoted or closed lost.
257160, 258160, That's what we saw there.
258160, 259160, Yeah.
259160, 260160, Any thoughts about that, Jason?
260160, 264840, Because I think we've noticed that in our go no go, you know, that they've kind of upticked
264840, 265840, as well.
265840, 269880, I'm just trying to use anything that's specific to that or.
269880, 273560, I don't, you know, and I don't know if it's just when you get to a certain time of year
273560, 278320, that this is just kind of what we run into when there are certain amount of transactions
278320, 283560, that kind of has an effect on all of them at once slowly but surely.
283560, 288440, But yeah, we did notice that in our numbers as well.
288440, 290120, There were some outliers.
290120, 292360, So we've actually excluded outliers here.
292360, 296400, I think the outliers, John is speaking, you know, make sense.
296400, 301560, It tends to be in some cases the outlier was just when you look at the data is clearly
301560, 305040, something where the status just hadn't been updated.
305040, 308080, The classic example for that were, for example, some of the accounts that got transferred
308080, 309760, to Michael Sharp.
309760, 314240, So they had been already in processing by a previous underwriter and got reassigned.
314240, 318440, So the time in submission is artificially longer.
318440, 319440, So some of them were weak.
319440, 323360, If you look at WICOpilot, some of them were before Copilot, but we just removed those
323360, 324840, because they were basically there.
324840, 328080, And there were a handful of submissions that were just massive.
328080, 330860, So it might also be that some of the larger submissions are there.
330860, 336320, So I think, for example, this is a Bluestone renewal, which is like a million dollar submission.
336320, 339320, I think that's the biggest submission that you guys have, the biggest risk that you guys
339320, 341600, have that's on Daniel's plate.
341600, 346840, And unsurprisingly, it takes longer just by virtue of it basically being a million dollar
346840, 348480, account.
348480, 352640, So it's possible that some of the impact that you see is just also the fact that maybe there's
352640, 356720, more, but more likely it might be just the fact that, you know, it might be just time
356720, 359480, of year you guys got some larger accounts that take longer.
359480, 360960, That's also possible.
360960, 361960, Yeah.
361960, 366560, And there are some one-ones and some accounts at this time of year that are larger and would
366560, 368720, have an impact on that as well.
368720, 373620, We also have some new underwriters that joined in the last few weeks.
373620, 378120, So if they're getting things assigned and maybe not getting to them yet, you might see
378120, 379800, an additional leg there as well.
379800, 380800, Got it.
380800, 385000, So the comparison here, you know, at this point, the phase one underwriters, other than
385000, 388160, Carol, I mean, Carol, I think the issue is that the submissions, frankly, I think she
388160, 390920, sends everything to Rush and we don't get it.
390920, 395680, So but other than Carol, when you compare the submissions that the underwriters in phase
395680, 400460, one have, the bulk of those with some of the exclusions I mentioned, and you compare kind
400460, 407760, of the comparable group, this is kind of the difference that you see, the 13 to 7.3.
407760, 411560, And kind of when looking at the cycle time, I want to be clear kind of what communicating
411560, 414600, here and it's possible that these might be misleading.
414600, 418320, Obviously, there's time spent on the cycle.
418320, 422360, So time spent from the time that you quote, which, of course, has implications to bind
422360, 423360, rate and such.
423360, 425080, And there's actual work, right?
425080, 429680, Sometimes the time, you know, sometimes there's some days when something is taking a while,
429680, 435000, but it's not like the underwriter is working 13 days straight on this, right?
435000, 439200, It clearly, you know, at some point where they are waiting for, for example, GSSE, that
439200, 440200, has that.
440200, 441540, So we're reducing some of that weight.
441540, 446840, But the actual decline in work, actual work is not 44%, it's about 20%.
446840, 452320, So actual time spent by an underwriter and an AU, before I think it was 17, 18, I forgot
452320, 454240, what we have for the previous numbers.
454240, 456400, Now it's about 19.
456400, 461400, But because now things, the time they're spending per quarter risk is not 13, it's not 30 days,
461400, 463680, it's more like three to six.
463680, 465440, And then that's down by 19%.
465440, 468840, So once the clear is up, cycle time.
468840, 471840, Exactly.
471840, 473640, Exactly.
473640, 477720, So we're seeing is the cycle time is down by 44 instead of 54.
477720, 480440, So a little bit smaller, but from a larger base.
480440, 481720, The calculation here is the same.
481720, 487960, You know, obviously we can, as we have discussed, we can try to get more QBE specific benchmarks,
487960, 489320, but here we're a little bit clearer.
489320, 494620, What we typically see is that 0.3 to 0.5 per day for winning rush submissions that would
494620, 499120, otherwise have been declined, another 0.3, 0.4% per day from quoting before other carriers
499120, 500120, are winning.
500120, 505280, That amounts, when you take that to six days decline, 3.4 to 5.1.
505280, 507880, So from that 30 to that, that's how we get this number here.
507880, 510260, So that's the premium impact.
510260, 516280, And then now there's the efficiency impact, which is 19% less time spent by the underwriters
516280, 518080, and AUs.
518080, 522680, And we do 2,700 quotes a year, three to six person days, kind of from the bottom up.
522680, 525880, This has remained the same we had before.
525880, 534200, That's where we get the effective six to 13, you know, mad years, I guess, in a way, is
534200, 535200, kind of the metric here.
535200, 542720, And as we mentioned, we want to put this in whatever context makes sense to you guys.
542720, 543720, Any questions so far?
543720, 549400, I mean, this is the, as of, you know, three days ago, we obviously can update this before
549400, 552400, the meeting, but certainly want to make sure that we're putting things in the right place.
552400, 556400, This is good and gives some, yeah, yeah.
556400, 561320, No, I'll make sense what I'm seeing here.
561320, 563440, And then these slides is the same that you had.
563440, 567520, These were looked from the surveys, basically, when we had low meetings.
567520, 569800, We added here a few small changes.
569800, 574920, So I had a few more examples that have happened since then in terms of, you know, surprising
574920, 577120, items.
577120, 582920, But I think given the discussion what I have on guidelines in a bit, I think by far, you
582920, 588040, know, before we go to the, okay, we found something that changed our decisions significantly
588040, 593080, and unexpected risk and needle in the haystack that, you know, will have lead to a big claim
593080, 594680, of which there are many here.
594680, 601000, Frankly, the fact that you guys look, you know, the fact that you guys have 13 day cycle
601000, 606960, times that the mid-market submissions that the underwriters are receiving are sizable
606960, 610200, and that the guidelines are actually fairly cumbersome.
610200, 615120, I think one of the things that can add much more value and quality as a baseline is just
615120, 619760, ensuring that guidelines are complied with every single time with no burden on the underwriter.
619760, 624440, The underwriter doesn't have to trade off speed for ensuring that the guidelines are
624440, 625520, met.
625520, 628680, That's something that copilot can do automatically.
628680, 629800, So where is it doing it?
629800, 630800, Like when is it?
630800, 636880, I should have probably paid more attention to how that.
636880, 637880, No, no, no.
637880, 639560, I think, I think it's a great question.
639560, 640800, And let me, let me show you this.
640800, 642800, I'm going to go backwards in this.
642800, 646200, But I think this is your question as well.
646200, 651000, Maybe it's not, but is to show where that information is coming from, from like what
651000, 656280, data database is it a Google searches and actual, you know, like federal or state.
656280, 657280, Yeah.
657280, 661960, And, and, and kind of like, like how's, how's the guidelines like, like, what are you looking
661960, 662960, for?
662960, 664560, Like what's your structure of what you're trying to solve?
664560, 665560, That makes sense.
665560, 666560, Yeah.
666560, 667560, Yeah.
667560, 668560, Yeah.
668560, 669560, No, no, no.
669560, 672720, Let me, let me answer the first one on how we would implement the guidelines.
672720, 676240, We haven't implemented the guidance for you guys yet, but let me tell you how we would
676240, 677240, do it.
677240, 680240, You guys basically have two options and both options.
680240, 685880, And there's only a third one coming up soon, but we have reviewed the documents that Jason
685880, 686880, sent.
686880, 689480, Let me show you an example of how this will work.
689480, 691760, So these are example of wildfire, right?
691760, 698040, So wildfire, you know, the guideline is a seven page Google document that Jason shared
698040, 699280, as we understand it.
699280, 705040, You know, basically there are depending on which state, if it's California, then there
705040, 708520, are sort of counties and the on the right has to check if the location is in those counties.
708520, 711640, If so, they have to run a fire line report.
711640, 716680, Either fire line report has a hazard score in the high or extreme, you decline the risk
716680, 718160, or need to get an exception.
718160, 723440, Similarly, if it's in a bunch of Western US states and the protection class is higher
723440, 728240, than PC6, then they have to check the same fire line report.
728240, 734760, Or if it's in Washington, except for some counties, protection protection class is P6
734760, 735760, or higher.
735760, 736760, They have to run it.
736760, 740600, Or if it's in Oregon, except for something like half a dozen counties, right?
740600, 743360, So that's the process as we understand it.
743360, 749720, And I'm sure then there's, you know, as a first set of checks, and then there is, you
749720, 751760, know, then there might be exceptions, right?
751760, 754600, So to give you an example, you know, that's just wildfire.
754600, 757520, And to us from looking at the guidelines, you're saying wildfire is like the easiest
757520, 760640, guideline to check off of the ones that you check, right?
760640, 763360, But you can imagine that, you know, let me show you an example here.
763360, 767520, I think we have, for example, this again, we don't know.
767520, 768600, This is an open question here.
768600, 769600, So wanted to understand more.
769600, 770600, This is the Chase store.
770600, 775720, This is a review from renewables that we saw in the book.
775720, 777200, This has a hundred locations.
777200, 781360, So you know, a hundred locations right now.
781360, 786960, Basically the hundred locations right now, presumably, you know, I don't know if it's
786960, 789480, the AU, if it's the underwriter, if it's GSSE.
789480, 792960, You have to look at each of the locations, see which counties you're in.
792960, 796560, If the counties are eligible or you're in a far line, you run the far lines for those
796560, 797560, reports.
797560, 803280, If it meets the conditions, then you either ask for an exclusion or reject the risk.
803280, 806400, So that's how we understand the process.
806400, 809880, From what we've heard from the underwriters before, you know, you kind of, if you have
809880, 813000, to do that for a hundred locations, you might not get the risk.
813000, 814600, They might do it for 15% of them.
814600, 817200, You look at the ones with the highest total insured value.
817200, 819080, Totally reasonable, right?
819080, 822280, In this particular case, for example, this is in the book and we don't know if there's
822280, 823280, an exception.
823280, 825400, We'd love to kind of, this is an open question, right?
825400, 830120, But there is one location that with copilot data from our data right now, it shows that
830120, 831720, it has a high wildfire risk.
831720, 835000, It's a location in Thousand Oaks, California out of 101.
835000, 836160, So maybe it is.
836160, 842320, So what we would like to understand is one, because it's in California, was a far line
842320, 843560, report requested for that?
843560, 844560, We don't know.
844560, 845560, Maybe it was.
845560, 850880, So maybe you guys already knew that this had to be checked, but if not, copilot was automatically.
850880, 855760, The second question is if it was checked, was it found to be in violation of guidelines?
855760, 858240, We don't know, but you guys, I'm sure know that.
858240, 860080, And if it did, then was there an exception?
860080, 867240, And if it wasn't, then again, you know, this is one case where copilot is automatic, right?
867240, 871080, And this is kind of going back to the ways to do it.
871080, 876960, Right now, immediately right now, we could implement the guideline for wildfire exactly
876960, 880440, as you have it written with the copilot wildfire data, right?
880440, 883120, And we can discuss with your team is the scores that we have.
883120, 888080, And we have kind of all the detail, all the detailed components that go into a wildfire
888080, 896280, score, which would be, you know, the fuel load, the urban, urban, wild, urban wildline
896280, 899000, interface, the slope, the wind.
899000, 900200, We have those pieces.
900200, 905440, And if you tell us, hey, you know, your team is happy to use our wildfire score, we can
905440, 908040, implement these rules by next week.
908040, 912160, And every single submission that comes in here, every single location will be checking
912160, 913160, as the guidelines.
913160, 914160, No problem.
914160, 917960, Let's say you don't want to do that because the scores that you guys have, or because
917960, 921400, the fire line piece is something that you need to have because your insurer asks us
921400, 922840, to do that.
922840, 927240, Any first party data that you add, if the submission has fire line or we're going to
927240, 932960, be API, whatever way, you know, Excel API, any other way, we can apply the guidelines
932960, 934120, on that as well.
934120, 935880, So the underwriter will need to do anything.
935880, 938440, I will still run the same things.
938440, 943520, And what's going to be coming in the spring is actually we're adding this interface, which
943520, 944520, is not live yet.
944520, 946800, I will call it the flight plan.
946800, 951120, You guys can modify the guidelines and that would apply to all the other ones.
951120, 957320, You can say now not only if the county, if your chief underwriting officer says, not
957320, 961200, only I want to make that screen a little bit larger, so I just want to kind of be able
961200, 963680, to read the, yeah, yeah, this is quite whatever.
963680, 973320, Yeah, this right now is kind of, let me put it in a blank slide.
973320, 978760, And that way if underwriting leadership says, okay, you know, we do not want to write anything
978760, 984640, in this county, copilot will automatically scan every submission to figure out when on
984640, 990600, a Friday morning at 8.30 a.m. you get a submission that happens to have scheduled locations in
990600, 992400, the county that'll flag it for the underwriter.
992400, 996280, They don't always need to search for it.
996280, 1001040, So basically right now we can implement these rules like the guidelines as you have them.
1001040, 1003600, We can implement those kind of on our end.
1003600, 1004600, There we go.
1004600, 1005600, Hard code them.
1005600, 1010680, But you will be able to actually modify those directly yourself.
1010680, 1016840, So the self-serve version is coming in probably early February, May February.
1016840, 1021240, But even now, like for example, the WALFR guidelines as you have them, we could add
1021240, 1027040, that next week just based on the WALFR data we have, which of course is not exactly the
1027040, 1031120, same as FAR line because we don't know exactly kind of which elements of FAR line you guys
1031120, 1034920, have and such.
1034920, 1039800, So hopefully that gives you a quick idea of how the guideline process will work.
1039800, 1042640, Does that answer your first question, Taylor and Jason?
1042640, 1046560, Yeah, yeah, I was just trying to.
1046560, 1053680, So where I was going is trying to understand how you translate that to basically to an
1053680, 1055480, algorithm type thing.
1055480, 1063600, I was kind of curious if you're not necessarily that you're coding it, but how you're deconstructing
1063600, 1069520, it to get to something that's searchable and that you can utilize for your checks.
1069520, 1074600, I think I understand now that I see this, how you structure this.
1074600, 1075600, Exactly.
1075600, 1081280, So right now, basically this interface is under development and one component that was
1081280, 1085000, important for us is, of course, we have logic in the back, but we want this to be accessible.
1085000, 1092400, Like obviously we're not expecting that we're going to have a manager and executive be writing
1092400, 1095440, code to implement a rule.
1095440, 1097480, So that will be pointless.
1097480, 1101400, So we're trying to make this a fairly intuitive interface.
1101400, 1106560, But ultimately what it is doing is it's flexible and yet kind of guides you towards setting
1106560, 1107560, up the guidelines.
1107560, 1108840, So in this particular case, what would it look like?
1108840, 1111840, You know, if that business is, and this has to be any, right?
1111840, 1114120, They will basically remove that piece.
1114120, 1116560, Any of your businesses would apply.
1116560, 1120320, So it wouldn't be dependent on the SAC code or the type of business.
1120320, 1125440, And it is in California.
1125440, 1130960, So location equals California or the following 12 counties.
1130960, 1137360, When wildfire risk is severe or high or severe, then, you know, what do you want?
1137360, 1140360, Do you want a flag for refer?
1140360, 1142880, Do you want an outright rejection?
1142880, 1146880, Do you want it to be put towards the bottom of the priority queue?
1146880, 1147880, As flexible.
1147880, 1158880, Similarly, if it is in Oregon and protection class is six or higher, six or higher or lower
1158880, 1166280, rather, I guess PC six or lower and is not in the following half a dozen counties and
1166280, 1168520, the score is lower, higher is this.
1168520, 1175120, Or for example, for hail, you'd be, if more than 25% of the locations are in high hail
1175120, 1179440, risk counties, then refer or raise a flag.
1179440, 1186400, So that's basically what we would implement.
1186400, 1190680, Okay.
1190680, 1191680, That makes sense.
1191680, 1196800, And then I guess, yeah, kind of to the second part of that question is disclosure about
1196800, 1201000, the data sources for where we're getting this from.
1201000, 1202000, Yeah, absolutely.
1202000, 1206840, Which we have talked about before, you know, the main, we tend to go to the source.
1206840, 1208880, But of course, the source provides you some information.
1208880, 1214200, For example, in terms of the flood risk, we have a lot of details on the flood itself,
1214200, 1217360, but the flood score we're showing here is the flood zone, right?
1217360, 1221760, So it's based on the flood zone and the flood zones that you guys use are, you have a little
1221760, 1227000, more nuance over the overall flood zone versus the ones that are just straight up provided
1227000, 1228000, by FEMA.
1228000, 1233200, On the other hand, we do have the components around the, you know, the distance to the
1233200, 1234780, plane, et cetera.
1234780, 1241760, So we could basically manufacture a score that ties to your guidelines or we just use
1241760, 1242760, your data.
1242760, 1243760, So it's entirely up to you.
1243760, 1248120, Yeah, and that's the question too, that we're going to have to bring back to the product
1248120, 1249120, and run.
1249120, 1250120, Exactly.
1250120, 1254600, Where you want to, you know, if we are going to pursue this, where do you want to make
1254600, 1255600, those changes?
1255600, 1256600, Do you want to amend the guidelines?
1256600, 1261080, You know, do we feel comfortable with the data that CLEPPA is bringing in or do we want
1261080, 1265960, to try to have it, you know, map or kind of build that exercise of, you know, okay, we're
1265960, 1270280, still going to use risk meter data and pull that in or we're going to go with, you know,
1270280, 1275200, whatever CLEPPA data found, you know, data CLEPPA found and use, you know, like a proxy
1275200, 1278160, kind of mapping to run that against the guidelines.
1278160, 1281520, Who on the product team, Jason, would be doing this?
1281520, 1283080, Is that more Charles or?
1283080, 1284080, I think it depends.
1284080, 1288440, I would start, yeah, Charles, it would be a good person to start with.
1288440, 1290680, All the cat stuff runs up through Charles.
1290680, 1291680, Okay.
1291680, 1296680, So, yeah, so our perspective here is we will do whatever makes sense to you.
1296680, 1302440, The software can work with either your data or ours, ours is right there, but, you know,
1302440, 1305400, basically we have, we have worked with clients that they tell us, you know what, we actually
1305400, 1309120, completely agree with your wildfire risk and the way you calculate it and the data behind
1309120, 1310120, it.
1310120, 1313320, We're all on board, but are really sure forces us to use their proprietary model.
1313320, 1314320, Can you put that in?
1314320, 1315320, The answer is yes.
1315320, 1316320, Yeah.
1316320, 1318600, And there might be stuff out there like that for us as well.
1318600, 1324280, Charles, our property expert has a tremendous amount of knowledge and background in that
1324280, 1325280, as well.
1325280, 1330560, And it would really be having that conversation of, you know, knowing the source and then
1330560, 1335320, understanding what that, you know, what that aligns with internally and if that's acceptable
1335320, 1338560, to use that or if we do want to continue with our own, our own data.
1338560, 1340120, That makes perfect sense.
1340120, 1344920, And whichever path you guys choose for kind of using the current data or mapping through
1344920, 1353200, co-pilot's data, currently, you know, a lot of these guidelines are not followed to the
1353200, 1359120, T because one, it's just prohibitive, you know, for time-wise or it's impractical.
1359120, 1364560, And therefore, if you can actually get, ensure that every single property, every single location,
1364560, 1369160, every schedule is monitored and have comfort that that's actually going to be flagged if
1369160, 1372400, there's something wrong with it that doesn't adhere to the guidelines, that just gives
1372400, 1377000, you guys kind of, and leadership, a lot more comfort that like we're doing things the way
1377000, 1378000, they should be.
1378000, 1379000, Yep.
1379000, 1385480, So there are two things that we'll be happy to do over the coming days if you guys can
1385480, 1389320, provide to us, which we'll review the renewals that we had.
1389320, 1392760, Jason, I believe you shared with us some renewals back at the very beginning, right?
1392760, 1395120, With probably 20 or so.
1395120, 1402920, And you sent us the list of renewals through April, but we don't have the SOVs or the actual,
1402920, 1406520, yeah, the properties PECS sheets.
1406520, 1410240, We'll be happy to run all the renewals if you can send those to us and particularly
1410240, 1416520, run the guidelines automatically in all of their locations with our data right now.
1416520, 1419120, But what we'll basically flag is like, you know, whatever.
1419120, 1423120, It could very well be like, for example, in this case, this is one renewal.
1423120, 1424720, There's only a single location.
1424720, 1429120, We found it to have a high, potentially high health score.
1429120, 1431800, It was Texas and I think Texas has slightly different guidelines.
1431800, 1433640, There was this building aggregation thing.
1433640, 1439120, Normally, we'll say, you know, hey, more than 25% are in high or severe or more than 30%
1439120, 1441720, are in high, then this would be the client.
1441720, 1443320, So obviously, we don't know the context.
1443320, 1447920, We don't know if our report was run, if there was an exception because it's just one location.
1447920, 1451160, But the reality is that if you provide a kind of with that context, we can just compare
1451160, 1455240, and very easily tell you, hey, there might be a handful of things here you might want
1455240, 1457040, to take another look at.
1457040, 1459080, Here's our identifying the risk.
1459080, 1461080, Does that tie up with the way you're doing it?
1461080, 1464640, And can provide you guys with kind of that report or some things in a moment and take
1464640, 1467600, a closer look at in the coming months before we know.
1467600, 1469080, Yep, that makes sense.
1469080, 1473880, And I think kind of to that point, is even if the data is slightly different, is it really
1473880, 1476960, going to be that different that it's going to have a material impact?
1476960, 1482320, Like if there's something that's in a flood zone, it's going to be in a flood zone.
1482320, 1486560, So there might be a certain bit of a workable room within that as well.
1486560, 1488440, Yeah, and we're flexible there.
1488440, 1491840, So ultimately, we'll use whatever data makes sense to you guys.
1491840, 1496400, The point in the functionality of the guideline, it can be a mix.
1496400, 1503240, You can even say, hey, you know, apply a rule or a guideline for this that is using for
1503240, 1507480, this part is using some color data and it's using some of our data that works.
1507480, 1509480, So it's completely flexible.
1509480, 1510480, Yeah.
1510480, 1515000, Yeah, I'm just worried if we run all our renewal stuff through our new business budget may
1515000, 1517000, go up significantly.
1517000, 1522960, Yeah, we might be running off of the book.
1522960, 1528920, Yeah, I mean, what we heard also from which as we go through these guidelines, I mean,
1528920, 1533600, one thing we have seen is in general, you know, we identify we ran out and we had here
1533600, 1538800, a handful submissions, found some areas which it's very, very likely that the guidelines
1538800, 1542560, were reviewed for the most part properly here is probably in compliance that probably well
1542560, 1543720, annotated.
1543720, 1545120, We will share these with you guys.
1545120, 1547120, And from our perspective, these are questions.
1547120, 1552000, We're not claiming this is wrong and you don't know what you're doing and copilot does simply
1552000, 1554200, we're saying, hey, did you take a look here?
1554200, 1559520, There might be something until we obviously understand fully what is it that these guidelines
1559520, 1561200, imply how they're deployed.
1561200, 1565120, We obviously have no awareness of what exceptions you made and why, but wanted to point that
1565120, 1566120, out.
1566120, 1569640, The one thing that is important is it's very easy to understand why the underwriters, you
1569640, 1574560, know, if you have 230 submissions, I think we have one recently that came in like Dutch
1574560, 1579840, mafia or something, we're happy to show you that 230 locations, you have a clock as an
1579840, 1585360, underwriter, you're looking at this, you know that if you send GSSE run 200 and turning
1585360, 1588160, report, they'll never reply to your email in your life.
1588160, 1591040, Of course, the underwriter is not going to do that.
1591040, 1592160, And that makes sense.
1592160, 1597720, I mean, the practical, the intelligent thing for the underwriter to do is not to do that.
1597720, 1602640, On the other hand, it might be the 97th location that has a problem that you need to know.
1602640, 1605200, Well, co-pilot doesn't have to make those trade-offs.
1605200, 1607800, Co-pilot runs things in parallel, not sequentially.
1607800, 1615320, So 200 locations, 500 locations, 5,000 locations, that's the same thing.
1615320, 1619320, So it can then give that leverage to the underwriter to then say, hey, it could very well be, hey,
1619320, 1621320, there's two locations here that have a problem.
1621320, 1625200, And then the underwriter says, two locations, the roof looks fine.
1625200, 1627160, These are new buildings.
1627160, 1628160, We can exclude them.
1628160, 1629160, We're good to go.
1629160, 1634440, Versus either I'm too conservative or I lose the deal because I'm taking too long.
1634440, 1639840, Or you put something and then you behave with a $2 million roof repair claim and some building
1639840, 1650720, in Georgia.
1650720, 1653120, So Jason, we can follow up separately.
1653120, 1658200, We'll send you both, summarizing these ones that we found, again, where we have questions.
1658200, 1661360, And you guys might have more context internally.
1661360, 1666840, And then if you can send the files for us to load the remaining renewals, we're more
1666840, 1667840, than happy to do that.
1667840, 1669840, We'll load them all.
1669840, 1671720, Yeah, I think we can do that.
1671720, 1674840, I probably have a team put those again in a folder.
1674840, 1677800, Hopefully this time is smoother than the last one.
1677800, 1681960, Although I saw your note, I think it was today on the mailbox.
1681960, 1687680, Yeah, we noticed that the new business, the way we noticed this is because it probably
1687680, 1690560, took us a little bit longer than what I'd like for us to notice.
1690560, 1694160, But the submissions from Tyler declined.
1694160, 1695160, And it's that.
1695160, 1698840, I think most of Tyler's submissions are coming through the new business.
1698840, 1701000, Basically I think we have discussed this before.
1701000, 1703200, So you have mentioned what we're seeing.
1703200, 1708600, We have seen an ebb and flow of submissions coming in and being analyzed, which is pretty
1708600, 1715480, much tied to the business and the business you're getting.
1715480, 1723040, It's been pretty consistent for Danielle, for Lee, for Michael, and for David.
1723040, 1724320, And Tyler went down.
1724320, 1725400, And we're reviewing these.
1725400, 1728480, We saw, okay, we seem to be missing submissions for Taylor.
1728480, 1737040, A few of the submissions that didn't go through the corporate mailbox for folks like Lee and
1737040, 1741860, Danielle, actually Rhea and Jen sent to us directly asking us to add them.
1741860, 1744080, So that's what we had and kind of picked up on that.
1744080, 1749360, And then Carol is the one that I think she exclusively uses Rush because we don't see
1749360, 1750360, accounts like that.
1750360, 1753360, I'm taking that to the bank.
1753360, 1756240, I don't doubt that.
1756240, 1758960, But okay, yeah, we'll make sure we get...
1758960, 1762960, I think that frankly, the accounts for Carol, I would say, I think what the renewals that
1762960, 1763960, you guys sent.
1763960, 1768000, She'll probably come back and ask to say that she didn't know there was another mailbox.
1768000, 1769000, There you go.
1769000, 1776960, Whichever you think, the good thing though is for the other folks, there's been a wide
1776960, 1780760, range of submissions, large, small, consistent.
1780760, 1786600, So that has given us kind of a cross sectors, which actually makes...
1786600, 1790720, There's sufficient data points on those to kind of arrive at this.
1790720, 1795360, And we have found kind of a few of these examples, which is obviously what we want to see.
1795360, 1799840, But of course, we want to make sure that before we go live with everybody, we can ensure all
1799840, 1802840, the submissions are flowing through.
1802840, 1803840, Good.
1803840, 1812920, And one question for you guys in terms of the steering committee meeting, what is the
1812920, 1818440, format that you would kind of see as being most effective in terms of orienting the audience
1818440, 1821440, and kind of getting them up to speed?
1821440, 1824720, Obviously, we've been kind of reviewing these slides with you guys.
1824720, 1829440, It might make sense for you guys to actually kind of present some of them.
1829440, 1830440, We can present...
1830440, 1831440, Yeah, yeah.
1831440, 1832440, I think that's how it would be.
1832440, 1833440, And then we'd have you...
1833440, 1834440, We'll look at it back there.
1834440, 1835440, We'll probably take this.
1835440, 1838440, This will probably be like the source.
1838440, 1846520, We'll kind of QB some, but I think it would be good to...
1846520, 1849160, It's a nice format that you have.
1849160, 1852080, And probably Jason and I will kind of start off.
1852080, 1859440, And then it probably dig into some areas like Paul kind of how you described.
1859440, 1866400, I think we'll focus on the efficiency and types of gains and why we think it's good
1866400, 1867640, for QB.
1867640, 1873200, I think where something like you just did on talking about underwriting rules and how
1873200, 1879600, that would be implemented and things would probably be a good area to maybe kind of sidebar
1879600, 1880600, on that.
1880600, 1881600, 100%.
1881600, 1882600, Absolutely.
1882600, 1883600, That makes a lot of sense.
1883600, 1885080, That makes a lot of sense.
1885080, 1890080, And as we think through it, we always look at what's happening here.
1890080, 1895800, And there are a couple of components that, as we plan, are coming later.
1895800, 1898320, The three-edging, of course, is something that we haven't touched yet, but you guys
1898320, 1899520, know that that's part of it.
1899520, 1902640, And if we get all the submissions to come through, there's no reason we cannot implement
1902640, 1906480, those rules upfront to three-edge and incorporate appetite.
1906480, 1908320, Furthermore, yeah, the guidelines.
1908320, 1911760, We spent a lot of time incorporating those guidelines.
1911760, 1914640, And Jason, you have mentioned the loss control.
1914640, 1916080, We reviewed those loss control guidelines.
1916080, 1917080, It's the same.
1917080, 1918080, Those are rules.
1918080, 1924360, So we absolutely can add those and provide kind of to the loss control team as helpful
1924360, 1932000, access to underwriter, to copilot, to facilitate those desktop and virtual inspections as necessary.
1932000, 1935000, I think we'll have to kind of think through it.
1935000, 1941440, It's not that hard to think about it, but of the audience and kind of initially, I think
1941440, 1946000, when we were first talking to you guys, it was like, well, we don't even have guidelines
1946000, 1947840, or we need to get guidelines first.
1947840, 1950480, So let's not worry about trying to get those in.
1950480, 1954040, But I think in practical purposes, there really are.
1954040, 1959000, Obviously, there are some guidelines and there's things we can do that have big impact.
1959000, 1963760, You may not get the super granular level, but there's some things that we can do in
1963760, 1973480, this, keep on pushing back that we know we get submissions that have 100, 200, 300 locations.
1973480, 1974480, That's not uncommon.
1974480, 1975480, Not at all.
1975480, 1983280, And if we want to, that's kind of what we expect to see.
1983280, 1987640, So here's how we can make decisions very quickly when we have that.
1987640, 1989760, So I think that's good.
1989760, 1994200, I had some other thing that was just kind of going through my mind here.
1994200, 2002800, Yeah, probably like where Jason and I will focus is on how it fits into the QB process
2002800, 2005600, and talk about efficiencies and effectiveness.
2005600, 2012840, And again, where you can come in is probably highlight some of the things that the software
2012840, 2017080, is doing and then where you guys are going, some things that where you're going.
2017080, 2020520, So I think that would be pretty powerful discussion.
2020520, 2021520, 100%.
2021520, 2026680, And we're going to send this to you right after, but we've added some materials on that,
2026680, 2027680, Taylor.
2027680, 2030920, Obviously, per request of your team, we have implemented a few other things.
2030920, 2033960, So for example, the Stabular Reporting View, which hopefully you guys have been able to
2033960, 2034960, see.
2034960, 2039600, This was implemented per popular request at QBE.
2039600, 2044280, What this does is it essentially allows them, the underwriters and AUs to put together those
2044280, 2047280, reports that take quite a long time to do.
2047280, 2050080, That's a one click process right now.
2050080, 2055400, One area where we might want to have just a slide and maybe it's something we put together
2055400, 2063680, is, you know, so at QBE, we're doing a lot of things.
2063680, 2069880, We're, you know, somewhat joking that Jason and I have been asking for things for a long
2069880, 2071880, time and now we're starting to get it.
2071880, 2076040, And now we're getting what we asked for and it creates a whole lot of work.
2076040, 2085280, But this idea that, you know, are we putting in, like are we piecemealing things or is
2085280, 2087840, there a real plan there?
2087840, 2091360, And we probably say, well, a little bit of both, you know.
2091360, 2096360, There is a plan we want to have when we think about the end-to-end process.
2096360, 2100720, This fits in nicely into kind of our needs to have.
2100720, 2106280, There's a piece in the upfront submission on how data actually comes in that we want
2106280, 2107280, to have.
2107280, 2108280, We have our policy admin system.
2108280, 2113640, We have our forms controlled through, you know, product risk genius.
2113640, 2118480, We don't have an underwriting workstation, but that's something, you know, ultimately
2118480, 2121480, that would be kind of bring everything together.
2121480, 2126760, But in the meantime, how does something like this truly integrate without it being now
2126760, 2130160, another tool that an underwriter or AU needs to go to?
2130160, 2132800, So that's, I think we need to be able to explain that.
2132800, 2138800, Not as much to Dan, but someone like Tom Fitzgerald who heads the SNC area that, you know, we're
2138800, 2142960, not, we're making the underwriter's life easier.
2142960, 2147240, We're not adding another tool or another place they need to go to.
2147240, 2152720, And part of it's hard to explain that, well, there really isn't anything that does it all
2152720, 2154740, or does it all well.
2154740, 2161180, So what we need to do is bring in these pieces and then start to integrate these pieces so
2161180, 2166440, that when you are an underwriter or an AU, you don't necessarily know that you're utilizing
2166440, 2171160, all this software or different software and it's just all integrated there.
2171160, 2172160, 100%.
2172160, 2176240, And I think there's certainly many things that we can do on our end to support that
2176240, 2177240, case that you're building.
2177240, 2181600, And I know we have discussed more broadly around the underwriting workstation.
2181600, 2185040, So certainly as we're going through it, you know, the last thing we want is that the underwriters
2185040, 2188360, need to go move data from a system into Co-pilot.
2188360, 2193160, That fortunately we're getting ahead of it by taking things directly from those inboxes,
2193160, 2194160, which is good.
2194160, 2200120, So we have actually seen cases where we actually get things in Co-pilot a day before they
2200120, 2202160, top on Salesforce.
2202160, 2207360, So certainly that's something that we were proud of and I want to expand upon where we
2207360, 2208640, facilitate that.
2208640, 2212440, But now we have automated the changes of status.
2212440, 2215880, When we get that report, it updates the status automatically in Co-pilot.
2215880, 2217720, The underwriter doesn't need to do anything.
2217720, 2221000, We don't have the feedback loop backwards, but that's something we can do where in theory
2221000, 2225000, the underwriter update status here, we should push that to Salesforce.
2225000, 2226920, That's certainly something we can do as well.
2226920, 2231280, And similarly, when the underwriter decides to quote or such, another integration we do
2231280, 2234260, have available is then push into your policy admin system.
2234260, 2235720, That's actually something we can do as well.
2235720, 2238840, And we had discussed about it before, we just have implemented it in this phase.
2238840, 2242520, So from our perspective, the underwriter should not have to be moving data anywhere.
2242520, 2245700, As a matter of fact, there might be places where they are already moving data from one
2245700, 2248380, system to another that we could make go away.
2248380, 2253000, So for example, these reports, as we understand it, they put together the spreadsheets, those
2253000, 2255960, reports and they go on present to the retail committee.
2255960, 2260000, And then I imagine they put those somewhere in some sort of repository.
2260000, 2262680, That can happen all within Co-pilot.
2262680, 2268520, Yeah, no, I'll make sense.
2268520, 2275320, And yeah, I think we just need to be ready to kind of explain or discuss how and also
2275320, 2282980, that especially in the POC, we're just, we're taking it out of the box and we're doing some
2282980, 2288720, things behind the scenes, but ultimately, we would definitely streamline this process.
2288720, 2289720, Okay, good.
2289720, 2290720, Thank you.
2290720, 2292760, No, no, thank you.
2292760, 2297880, I think certainly we're here to help and want to make sure that it's a seamless process.
2297880, 2302160, And certainly, I think we want to make sure, as we've told you guys before, we want to
2302160, 2307560, make sure we focus on what we promise we're going to do, deliver on that, and then we'll
2307560, 2309440, make more promises after that.
2309440, 2314920, But certainly, after we have these plays in a way that suits all the needs that we have,
2314920, 2320960, particularly around guidelines and other of those integrations, then yeah, I mean, I know
2320960, 2325520, you guys have mentioned a few times and I believe it was Alex had mentioned, well, can
2325520, 2329960, we put some of the data that has now been collected in that internal database into Co-pilot
2329960, 2331720, so you have everything unified?
2331720, 2332720, Absolutely.
2332720, 2336280, And for example, some of these reports that you see here, some of this information, this
2336280, 2340040, is taking data from Co-pilot, it's taking data from the submission, and it could take
2340040, 2342480, data from any other first party source that you guys have.
2342480, 2347520, And I do really think that I know that we don't want to delve too far into that because
2347520, 2351680, this is really about the, you know, the POC and kind of a more immediate need.
2351680, 2356180, But I do think that's really a key part of the conversation is the potential for that
2356180, 2362160, growth to say, you know what, we're here today, tomorrow we can have, you know, an API to
2362160, 2366560, Salesforce so that if you know, both direct, you know, I said if you're closing out and
2366560, 2370760, wanted to talk to the other one, you could have an API with image, right, which is our
2370760, 2373160, task management platform, similar concept.
2373160, 2378680, Like if I hit go in Culepa, it will actually kick off a task to have the, you know, all
2378680, 2381320, the back office folks work on it.
2381320, 2385680, And then that underwriting dashboard part of, hey, you know what, we can integrate with
2385680, 2390840, your data, you know, through insights and actually pull in historical loss information
2390840, 2394820, or any other, you know, structured data that we feed in for that component.
2394820, 2401040, And to at least talk about that because I think from, you know, at that level, they
2401040, 2404840, want to see something that can be long-term and that will serve multiple needs as we go
2404840, 2405840, forward.
2405840, 2406840, 100%.
2406840, 2409240, And we want to be that solution for you guys.
2409240, 2414960, Jason, one thing that could be helpful there, the capability is here, right?
2414960, 2417880, With those renewals, I mean, with the new business, of course, you have the loss runs
2417880, 2419480, and we got those loss runs.
2419480, 2423600, But I imagine with the renewals, you probably have the loss history within QBE as well,
2423600, 2424600, right?
2424600, 2425600, Yeah, right.
2425600, 2430040, It should be much easier to, the incoming loss history is tough and I wouldn't expect
2430040, 2433240, you guys and the software to be able to handle that.
2433240, 2438920, But we should have, I mean, data formatted in a way from internal perspective that you
2438920, 2441240, should be able to handle.
2441240, 2444760, So on the loss runs, I don't know, format it, we're working on it, but that's not live
2444760, 2446720, yet, but it will be.
2446720, 2449720, But it's only for the renewals.
2449720, 2455520, If you're sending us the renewal information for us to run them, again, if it's easily
2455520, 2460000, accessible, if you can share some of the loss history, we can add that here.
2460000, 2462700, So the report will have losses as well.
2462700, 2468080, So when we're presenting these to STIRCO, they can see, if losses are plugged into this,
2468080, 2470560, then the losses will be here as well.
2470560, 2471560, That's not a bad idea.
2471560, 2477880, Taylor, what do you think the Power BI stuff would be the easiest?
2477880, 2481600, Or what's I'm trying to think of?
2481600, 2485120, Or yeah, probably the Power BI, yeah.
2485120, 2491120, Because that's what's going to come from data insights or it'll be structured from that.
2491120, 2492760, Okay.
2492760, 2495520, I can send you guys a file.
2495520, 2501960, Do you just want it to be generic or do we have a live account that?
2501960, 2505040, We'll take whatever you have.
2505040, 2510120, I think the ideal case scenario would be if you guys already have kind of standardized
2510120, 2513380, way from Power BI for those renewals.
2513380, 2518280, So if you're sending us kind of the SOVs and such, in addition to that, you have some sort
2518280, 2521320, of output of one of your systems that has the losses.
2521320, 2526120, Presumably, imagine you will have the insurer name or the policy ID, maybe has the location
2526120, 2530360, where the loss happened, maybe the amount, maybe the date.
2530360, 2535360, If you have those, then we can incorporate them.
2535360, 2536360, Okay.
2536360, 2537360, Yeah.
2537360, 2544400, I was just thinking of the source we were just talking about doesn't at least the interface
2544400, 2547920, doesn't get down to that level, I don't think.
2547920, 2549040, What does that source provide you?
2549040, 2551360, I mean, we don't want to make it...
2551360, 2553520, It's really more at a claim level.
2553520, 2557560, So you have a claim and then you have a lot of policy ID tied to it?
2557560, 2558560, Yeah.
2558560, 2563440, So you have policy ID, claim date, claim, I imagine type of claim or description of
2563440, 2565960, the claim and the loss amount.
2565960, 2566960, Yeah.
2566960, 2567960, Yeah.
2567960, 2570000, I mean, that might be sufficient to start.
2570000, 2573520, Certainly, if there's anything more granular to a location, we'll talk to individual locations.
2573520, 2575160, So for example, we'd love to show...
2575160, 2583680, We should pull stuff, Jason, I guess from claims center or something.
2583680, 2585400, Have you ever accessed that data directly?
2585400, 2586400, I don't.
2586400, 2587400, I know.
2587400, 2594480, That's why it's easier for us to use one of the tools that we would utilize.
2594480, 2596800, So let's say some, I just kind of...
2596800, 2598960, Yeah, we'll think about it and we'll talk about it.
2598960, 2604240, And at the very worst, we could just mock something up, I think too of, this is what
2604240, 2605720, it could eventually look like.
2605720, 2606720, Yeah.
2606720, 2609720, But I think that's like a key component and it's not that hard.
2609720, 2613800, It probably wouldn't be that hard, but that's like one of those key components.
2613800, 2617680, All this data is, so just so you guys haven't...
2617680, 2621520, And I think we've talked about this before, but we have a large project of moving all
2621520, 2623320, our data into one source.
2623320, 2625520, It's called Data Insights.
2625520, 2634240, So ultimately everything flows through that data mark, which will be nice because historically
2634240, 2638240, we've had to go to individual systems to get everything.
2638240, 2640400, So you have multiple systems.
2640400, 2641640, So that will be nice.
2641640, 2644320, But that's where you would get your data from ultimately.
2644320, 2646320, We would pull some data.
2646320, 2647320, That sounds phenomenal.
2647320, 2648320, Yeah.
2648320, 2649320, I just don't think...
2649320, 2653000, Yeah, it's one of those things that could...
2653000, 2655440, We could talk to someone on the Data Insights team.
2655440, 2656920, I just don't want it to become a project.
2656920, 2657920, Yeah, right.
2657920, 2659920, That was kind of my thought too.
2659920, 2660920, Yeah.
2660920, 2661920, Yeah.
2661920, 2664360, Can we just go run something ourselves and then start pushing it?
2664360, 2665360, Yeah.
2665360, 2666920, We'll work with whatever is easy.
2666920, 2671760, Right now I think what we want to do is, obviously as we're putting this...
2671760, 2675560, When we talk to a circle, obviously we want to show what we have done.
2675560, 2678320, And I think we have some numbers here and looking for your feedback.
2678320, 2681400, But then also kind of what are the elements that are ahead?
2681400, 2685600, And certainly you guys have a vision for implementing this.
2685600, 2687400, We can get you kind of basic loss run information.
2687400, 2693440, It's actually the information that the underwriters would use and probably only if they saw some
2693440, 2696720, anomalies and they want to drill down into more detail.
2696720, 2700480, But it would be like the base information that they would use for their renewal process.
2700480, 2701480, Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
2701480, 2704880, Because you can imagine it would be, for example, just to give you an example here of kind of
2704880, 2707800, what was running through my mind, which I imagine it would be what your underwriters
2707800, 2712400, would want, which is you're renewing this account and whatever.
2712400, 2718660, The Hale exposure for whatever reason didn't fully capture and there was a Hale loss there
2718660, 2720080, in the past year.
2720080, 2721080, We will flag this immediately.
2721080, 2722080, Right?
2722080, 2726640, So you can basically say, okay, we will have avoided that loss.
2726640, 2732360, But that loss was entirely avoidable and we can make sure that doesn't happen.
2732360, 2733360, Yep.
2733360, 2734360, Okay.
2734360, 2735360, All right.
2735360, 2736360, This is good.
2736360, 2737360, Good stuff.
2737360, 2738360, Good.
2738360, 2739360, Wonderful.
2739360, 2741360, So I'm going to go ahead and send that to you right after this meeting.
2741360, 2742360, All right.
2742360, 2743360, Thank you.
2743360, 2744360, Anything else for the day?
2744360, 2746880, I think that's all we got.
2746880, 2748640, So definitely let us know.
2748640, 2751520, We'll get that all scheduled.
2751520, 2752520, Good.
2752520, 2757520, I just got two IMs while we were talking, so I get two more meetings after this.
2757520, 2763120, I'm trying to not to hurry this along, but this is all productive.
2763120, 2764120, So this is good.
2764120, 2765680, I appreciate you both taking the time.
2765680, 2768400, I appreciate it so late and good luck with those meetings, Taylor.
2768400, 2769400, So we'll be in touch then.
2769400, 2770760, We'll look forward to hearing from you on the scheduling.
2770760, 2774840, We'll send this out and then whatever data you guys can send on those renewals, send
2774840, 2775920, them our way.
2775920, 2780200, And then Taylor will follow up as well with more details and let us know if they're saying
2780200, 2781200, we should be doing procurement folks.
2781200, 2783200, We haven't heard from them yet.
2783200, 2784200, Good.
2784200, 2785200, Perfect.
2785200, 2786200, Thank you.
2786200, 2789320, You guys have a good evening and we'll talk to you next couple of days.
2789320, 2790320, You too.
2790320, 2791320, Take care.
2791320, 2811640, Bye bye.
